<h2><span class="gesp">PREFACE</span>.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">This</span> work on the Renaissance in Italy, of which I now give the last two
volumes to the public, was designed and executed on the plan of an essay
or analytical inquiry, rather than on that which is appropriate to a
continuous history. Each of its four parts&#8212;the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15400"><i>Age of the Despots</i></a>,
the <i>Revival of Learning</i>, the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11559"><i>Fine Arts</i></a>, and <i>Italian
Literature</i>&#8212;stood in my mind for a section; each chapter for a
paragraph; each paragraph for a sentence. At the same time, it was
intended to make the first three parts subsidiary and introductory to
the fourth, for which accordingly a wider space and a more minute method
of treatment were reserved. The first volume was meant to explain the
social and political conditions of Italy; the second to relate the
exploration of the classical past which those conditions necessitated,
and which determined the intellectual activity of the Italians; the
third to exhibit the bias of this people toward figurative art, and
briefly to touch upon its various manifestations; in order that,
finally, a correct point of view might be obtained for judging of their
national literature in its strength and limitations. Literature must
always prove the surest guide to the investigator of a people's
character at some decisive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">-vi-</a></span> epoch. To literature, therefore, I felt that
the plan of my book allowed me to devote two volumes.</p>

<p>The subject of my inquiry rendered the method I have described, not only
natural but necessary. Yet there are special disadvantages, to which
progressive history is not liable, in publishing a book of this sort by
installments. Readers of the earlier parts cannot form a just conception
of the scope and object of the whole. They cannot perceive the relation
of its several sections to each other, or give the author credit for his
exercise of judgment in the marshaling and development of topics. They
criticise each portion independently, and desire a comprehensiveness in
parts which would have been injurious to the total scheme. Furthermore,
this kind of book sorely needs an Index, and its plan renders a general
Index, such as will be found at the end of the last volume, more
valuable than one made separately for each part.</p>

<p>Of these disadvantages I have been rendered sensible during the progress
of publication through the last six years. Yet I have gained some
compensation in the fact that the demand for a second edition of the
first volume has enabled me to make that portion of the work more
adequate.</p>

<p>With regard to authorities consulted in these two concluding volumes, I
have special pleasure in recording none&#8212;with only insignificant
exceptions&#8212;but Italian names. The Italians have lately made vigorous
strides in the direction of sound historical research and scientific
literary criticism. It is not too much to say that the labors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">-vii-</a></span> this
generation are rapidly creating a radical change in the views hitherto
accepted concerning the origins and the development of Italian
literature. Theories based on rational investigation and philosophical
study are displacing the academical opinions of the last century. The
Italians are forming for themselves a just conception of their past, at
the same time that they are consolidating their newly-gained political
unity.</p>

<p>To dwell upon the works of Francesco de Sanctis and Pasquale Villari is
hardly necessary here. The former is perhaps less illustrious by
official dignity than by his eloquent <i>Storia della Letteratura
Italiana</i>. The latter has gained European reputation as the biographer
of Savonarola and Machiavelli, the historian of Florence at their epoch.
But English readers are probably not so familiar with acute and accurate
criticism of Giosu&#232; Carducci; with the erudition of Alessandro d'Ancona,
and the voluminous history of the veteran Cesare Cant&#249;; with the
intelligence and facile pen of Adolfo Bartoli; with the philological
researches of Napoleone Caix, and Francesco Fiorentino's philosophical
studies; with Rajna's patient labors in one branch of literary history,
and Monaci's discoveries in another; with the miscellaneous
contributions to scholarship and learning made by men like Comparetti,
Guasti, D'Ovidio, Rubieri, Milanesi, Campori, Passano, Biagi, Pitr&#233;,
Tigri, Vigo, Giudici, Fracassetti, Fanfani, Bonghi, Grion, Mussafia,
Morsolin, Del Lungo, Virgili. While alluding thus briefly to students
and writers, I should be sorry to omit the names of those
publishers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">-viii-</a></span>&#8212;the Florentine Lemonnier, Barb&#232;ra, Sansoni; the Neapolitan
Morano; the Palermitan Lauriel; the Pisan Vico and Nistri; the Bolognese
Romagnoli and Zanichelli&#8212;through whose spirited energy so many works of
erudition have seen the light.</p>

<p>I have mentioned names almost at random, passing over (not through
forgetfulness, but because space compels me) many writers to whom I owe
weighty obligations. The notes and references in these volumes will, I
trust, contain acknowledgment sufficient to atone for omissions in this
place.</p>

<p>Not a few of these distinguished men hold professorial appointments; and
it is clear that they are forming students in the great Italian cities,
to continue and complete their labors. Very much remains to be explored
in the field of Italian literary history. The future promises a harvest
of discovery scarcely less rich than that of the last half-century. On
many moot points we can at present express but partial or provisional
judgments. The historian of the Renaissance must feel that his work,
when soundest, may be doomed to be superseded, and when freshest, will
ere long seem antiquated. So rapid is the intellectual movement now
taking place in Italy.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it remains for me to add that certain passages in
<a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter
II.</a> have been reproduced from an article by me in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>, while some translations from Poliziano and Boiardo, together
with portions of the critical remarks upon those poets, were first
published, a few years since, in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">-ix-</a></span> the
<i>Fortnightly Review</i>, again, I have extracted the translation of ten
sonnets by Folgore da San Gemignano.</p>

<p>In quoting from Italian writers, in the course of this literary history,
I have found it best to follow no uniform plan; but, as each occasion
demanded, I have given the Italian text, or else an English version, or
in some cases both the original and a translation. To explain the
motives for my decision in every particular, would involve too much
expenditure of space. I may, however, add that the verse-translations in
these volumes are all from my pen, and have been made at various times
for the special purpose of this work.</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Between</span> 1300, the date of Dante's vision, and 1530, the date of the fall
of Florence, the greatest work of the Italians in art and literature was
accomplished. These two hundred and thirty years may be divided into
three nearly equal periods. The first ends with Boccaccio's death in
1375. The second lasts until the birth of Lorenzo de' Medici in 1448.
The third embraces the golden age of the Renaissance. In the first
period Italian literature was formed. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">-2-</a></span> the second intervened the
studies of the humanists. In the third, these studies were carried over
to the profit of the mother tongue. The first period extends over
seventy-five years; the second over seventy-three; the third over
eighty-two. With the first date, 1300, we may connect the jubilee of
Boniface and the translation of the Papal See to Avignon (1304); with
the second, 1375, the formation of the Albizzi oligarchy in Florence
(1381); with the third, 1448, the capture of Constantinople (1453); and
with the fourth, 1530, the death of Ariosto (1533) and the new direction
given to the Papal policy by the Sack of Rome (1527).</p>

<p>The chronological limits assigned to the Italian Renaissance in the
first volume of this work would confine the history of literature to
about eighty years between 1453 and 1527; and it will be seen by
reference to the foregoing paragraph that it would not be impossible to
isolate that span of time. In dealing with Renaissance literature, it so
happens that strict boundaries can be better observed than in the case
of politics, fine arts, or learning. Yet to adhere to this section of
literary history without adverting to the antecedent periods, would be
to break the chain of national development, which in the evolution of
Italian language is even more important than in any other branch of
culture. If the renascence of the arts must be traced from Cimabue and
Pisano, the spirit of the race, as it expressed itself in modern speech,
demands a still more retrogressive survey, in order to render the
account of its ultimate results intelligible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">-3-</a></span></p>

<p>The first and most brilliant age of Italian literature ended with
Boccaccio, who traced the lines on which the future labors of the nation
were conducted. It was succeeded by nearly a century of Greek and Latin
scholarship. To study the masterpieces of Dante and Petrarch, or to
practice their language, was thought beneath the dignity of men like
Valla, Poggio, or Pontano. But toward the close of the fifteenth
century, chiefly through the influence of Lorenzo de' Medici and his
courtiers, a strong interest in the mother-tongue revived. Therefore the
vernacular literature of the Renaissance, as compared with that of the
expiring middle ages, was itself a renascence or revival. It reverted to
the models furnished by Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, and combined
them with the classics, which had for so long a while eclipsed their
fame. Before proceeding to trace the course of the revival, which forms
the special subject of these volumes, it will be needful to review the
literature of the fourteenth century, and to show under what forms that
literature survived among the people during the classical enthusiasm of
the fifteenth century. Only by this antecedent investigation can the new
direction taken by the genius of the combined Italian nation, after the
decline of scholarship, be understood. Thus the three sub-periods of the
two hundred and thirty years above described may be severally named the
medieval, the humanistic, and the renascent. To demonstrate their
connection and final explication is my purpose in this last section of
my work on the Renaissance.</p>

<p>In the development of a modern language Italy showed less precocity than
other European nations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">-4-</a></span> The causes of this tardiness are not far to
seek. Latin, the universal tongue of medieval culture, lay closer to the
dialects of the peninsula than to the native speech of Celtic and
Teutonic races, for whom the official language of the Empire and the
Church always exhibited a foreign character. In Italy the ancient speech
of culture was at home: and nothing had happened to weaken its
supremacy. The literary needs of the Italians were satisfied with Latin;
nor did the genius of the new people make a vigorous effort to fashion
for itself a vehicle of utterance. Traditions of Roman education
lingered in the Lombard cities, which boasted of secular schools, where
grammarians and rhetoricians taught their art according to antique
method, long after the culture of the North had passed into the hands of
ecclesiastics.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> When Charlemagne sought to resuscitate learning, he
had recourse to these Italian teachers; and the importance of the
distinction between Italians and Franks or Germans, in this respect, was
felt so late as the eleventh century. Some verses in the Panegyric
addressed by Wippo to the Emperor Henry III. brings the case so vividly
before us that it may be worth while to transcribe them here<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>:</p>

<p>While the Italians thus continued the rhetorical and legal studies of
the ancients, they did not forget that they were representatives and
descendants of the Romans. The Republic and the Empire were for them the
two most glorious epochs of their own history; and any attempt which
they made to revive either literature or art, was imitative of the past.
They were not in the position to take a new departure. No popular epic,
like the Niebelungen of the Teuton, the Arthurian legend of the Celt,
the Song of Roland of the Frank, or the Spanish Cid, could have sprung
up on Italian soil. The material was wanting to a race that knew its own
antiquity. Even when an Italian undertook a digest of the Tale of Troy
or of the Life of Alexander, he converted the metrical romances of the
middle ages into prose, obeying an instinct which led him to regard the
classical past as part of his own history.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In like manner, the
recollection of a previous municipal organization in the communes,
together with the growing ideal of a Roman Empire, which should restore
Italy to her place of sovereignty among the nations, proved serious
obstacles to the unification of the people. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">-6-</a></span> have already seen that
this reversion of the popular imagination to Rome may be reckoned among
the reasons why the victory of Legnano and the Peace of Constance were
comparatively fruitless.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Politically, socially, and intellectually,
the Italians persisted in a dream of their Latin destiny, long after the
feasibility of realizing that vision had been destroyed, and when the
modern era had already formed itself upon a new type in the federation
of the younger races.</p>

<p>Of hardly less importance, as negative influences, were the failure of
feudalism to take firm hold upon Italian soil, and the defect of its
ideal, chivalry. The literature of trouv&#232;res, troubadours, and
minnesingers grew up and flourished in the castles of the North; nor was
it until the Italians, under the sway of the Hohenstauffen princes,
possessed something analogous to a Proven&#231;al Court, that the right
conditions for the development of literary art in the vernacular were
attained. From this point of view Dante's phrase of <i>lingua aulica</i>, to
express the dialect of culture, is both scientific and significant. It
will further appear in the course of this chapter that the earliest dawn
of Italian literature can be traced to those minor Courts of Piedmont
and the Trevisian Marches, where the people borrowed the forms of feudal
society more sympathetically than elsewhere in Italy.</p>

<p>It must moreover be remembered that during the eleventh and twelfth
centuries the force of the Italian people was concentrated upon two
great political struggles, the contest of the Church with the Empire,
and the War of Lombard Independence. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">-7-</a></span> prosecution of these
quarrels, the Italians lost sight of letters, art, theology. They became
a race of statesmen and jurists. Their greatest divines and
metaphysicians wandered northward into France and England. Their most
favored university, that of Bologna, acquired a world-famed reputation
as a school of jurisprudence. Legal studies and political activity
occupied the attention of their ablest men. It would be difficult to
overrate the magnitude of the work done during these two centuries. In
the course of them, the Italians gave final form to the organism of the
Papacy, which must be regarded as a product of their constructive
genius. They developed Republican governments of differing types in each
of their great cities, and made, for the first time since the foundation
of the Empire, the name of <i>People</i> sovereign. They resuscitated Roman
law, and reorganized the commerce of the Mediterranean. Remaining loyal
to the Empire as an idea, they shook off the yoke of the German C&#230;sars;
and while the Papacy was their own handiwork, they, alone of European
nations, viewed it politically rather than religiously, and so weakened
it as to prepare the way for the Babylonian captivity at Avignon.</p>

<p>Thus, through the people's familiarity with Latin; through the survival
of Roman grammar schools and the memory of Roman local institutions;
through a paramount and all-pervading enthusiasm for the Roman past;
through the lack of new legendary and epical material; through the
failure of feudalism, and through the political ferment attending on the
Wars of Investment and Independence, the Italians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">-8-</a></span> were slow to produce
a modern language and a literature of modern type. They came late into
the field; and when they took their place at last, their language
presented a striking parallel to their political condition. As they
failed to acquire a solid nationality, but remained split up into petty
States, united by a Pan-Italic sentiment; so they failed to form a
common speech. The written Italian of the future was used in its
integrity by no one province; each district clinging to its dialect with
obstinate pride.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Yet, though the race was tardy in literary
development, and though the tongue of Ariosto has never become so
thoroughly Italian as that of Shakspere is English or that of Moli&#232;re is
French; still, on their first appearance, the Italian masters proved
themselves at once capable of work maturer and more monumental than any
which had been produced in modern Europe. Their education during two
centuries of strife was not without effect. The conditions of
burghership in their free communes, the stirring of their political
energies, the liberty of their <i>popolo</i>, and the keen sense of reality
developed by their legal studies, prepared men like Dante and Guido
Cavalcanti for solving the problems of art in a resolute, mature and
manly spirit, fully conscious of the aim before them, and self-possessed
in the assurance of adult faculties.</p>

<p>In the first, or, as it may be termed, the Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">-9-</a></span> period of medieval
culture, there was not much to distinguish the Italians from the rest of
Europe. Those Lombard schools, of which mention has already been made,
did indeed maintain the traditions of decadent classical education more
alive than among the peoples of the North. Better Latin, and
particularly more fluent Latin verse, was written during the dark ages
in Italy than elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Still it does not appear that the whole
credit of medieval Latin hymnology, and of its curious counterpart, the
songs of the wandering students, should be attributed to the Italians.
While we can refer the <i>Dies Ir&#230;</i>, <i>Lauda Sion</i>, <i>Pange Lingua</i> and
<i>Stabat Mater</i> with tolerable certainty to Italian poets; while there is
abundant internal evidence to prove that some of the best <i>Carmina
Burana</i> were composed in Italy and under Italian influences; yet Paris,
the focus of theological and ecclesiastical learning, as Bologna was the
center of legal studies, must be regarded as the headquarters of that
literary movement which gave the rhyming hexameters of Bernard of Morlas
and the lyrics of the Goliardi to Europe.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It seems clear that we
cannot ascribe to the Italians of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
any superiority in the use of Latin over the school of France. Their
previous vantage-ground had been lost in the political distractions of
their country. At the same time, they were the first jurists <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">-10-</a></span>and the
hardiest, if not the most philosophical, freethinkers of Europe.</p>

<p>This is a point which demands at least a passing notice. Their practical
studies, and the example of an emperor at war with Christendom, helped
to form a sect of epicureans in Italy, for whom nothing sanctioned by
ecclesiastical authority was sacred. To these pioneers of modern
incredulity Dante assigned not the least striking Cantos of the
<i>Inferno</i>. Their appearance in the thirteenth century, during the
ascendancy of Latin culture, before the people had acquired a language,
is one of the first manifestations of a national bias toward positive
modes of thought and feeling, which we recognize alike in Boccaccio and
Ariosto, Machiavelli and Guicciardini, Pomponazzi and the speculators of
the South Italian School. It was the quality, in fact, which fitted the
Italians for their work in the Renaissance. As metaphysicians, in the
stricter sense of that word, they have been surpassed by Northern races.
Their religious sense has never been so vivid, nor their opposition to
established creeds so earnest. But throughout modern history their great
men have manifested a practical and negative good sense, worldly in its
moral tone, impervious to pietistic influences, antagonistic to
mysticism, contented with concrete reality, which has distinguished them
from the more fervent, boyish, sanguine, and imaginative enthusiasts of
Northern Europe. We are tempted to speculate whether, as they were the
heirs of ancient civility and grew up among the ruins of Roman greatness
so they were born spiritually old and disillusioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">-11-</a></span></p>

<p>Another point which distinguished the Italians in this Latin period of
their literature, was the absence of the legendary or myth-making
faculty. It is not merely that they formed no epic, and gave birth to no
great Saga; but they accepted the fabulous matter, transmitted to them
from other nations, in a prosaic and positive spirit. This does not
imply that they exercised a critical faculty, or passed judgment on the
products of the medieval fancy. On the contrary, they took legend for
fact, and treated it as the material of history. Hector, Alexander, and
Attila were stripped of their romantic environments, and presented in
the cold prose of a digest, as persons whose acts could be sententiously
narrated. This attitude of the Italians toward the Saga is by no means
insignificant. When their poets came to treat Arthurian or Carolingian
fables in the epics of Orlando, they apprehended them in the same
positive spirit, adding elements of irony and satire.</p>

<p>For the rest, the Italians shared with other nations the common stock of
medieval literature&#8212;Chronicles, Encyclop&#230;dias, Epitomes, Moralizations,
Histories in verse, Rhetorical Summaries, and prose abstracts of
Universal History&#8212;the meager <i>d&#233;bris</i> and detritus of the huge moraines
carried down by extinct classic glaciers. It is not needful to dwell
upon this aspect of the national culture, since it presents no specific
features. What is most to our purpose, is to note the affectionate
remembrance of Rome and Roman worthies, which endured in each great
town. The people, as distinguished from the feudal nobility, were and
ever felt themselves to be the heirs of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">-12-</a></span> Roman population.

<p>A rhyming chronicler of Pisa compared the battles of the burghers
against the Saracens with the Punic wars. The tomb of Virgil at Naples
was an object for pilgrimage, and one of the few spots round which a
group of local legends clustered. The memory of Livy added luster to
Padua, and Mussato boasted that her walls, like those of Troy, her
mother-city, were sacrosanct. The memory of the Plinies ennobled Como,
that of Ovid gave glory to Sulmona, that of Tully to Arpino. Florence
clung to the mutilated statue of Mars upon her bridge with almost
superstitious reverence, as proof of Roman origin; while Siena adopted
for her ensign the she-wolf and the Roman twins. Pagan customs survived,
and were jealously maintained in the central and southern provinces; and
the name of the Republic sufficed to stir Arnold's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">-13-</a></span>revolution in Rome,
long before the days of Rienzi. To the mighty German potentate, King
Frederick Barbarossa, attended with his Northern chivalry, a handful of
Romans dared to say: &quot;Thou wast a stranger; I, the City, gave thee civic
rights. Thou camest from transalpine regions; I have conferred on thee
the principality.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It would be easy to multiply these instances.
Enough, however, has been said to show that through the gloom of
medieval history, before humanism had begun to dawn, and while the other
nations were creating legends and popular epics, Italy maintained a dim
but tenacious sense of her Roman past. This consciousness has here to be
insisted on, not merely because it stood in the way of mythop&#339;ic
activity, but because it found full and proper satisfaction in that
Revival of Learning which decided the Renaissance.</p>

<p>While the Italians were fighting the Wars of Investiture and
Independence, two literatures had arisen in the country which we now
call France. Two languages, the <i>langue d'oc</i> and the <i>langue d'o&#239;l</i>,
gave birth to two separate species of poetry. The master-product of the
latter was the Song of Roland, which, together with the after-birth of
Arthurian romance, flooded Europe with narratives, embodying in a more
or less epical form the ideals, enthusiasms, and social creed of
Chivalry. The former, cultivated in the southern provinces that border
on the Mediterranean, yielded a refined and courtly fashion of lyrical
verse, which took the form of love-songs, battle-songs, and satires, and
which is now known as Proven&#231;al litera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">-14-</a></span>ture. The influence of feudal
culture, communicated through these two distinct but closely connected
channels, was soon felt in Italy. The second phase of Italian
development has been called Lombard, because it was chiefly in the north
of the peninsula that the motive force derived from France was active.
Yet if we regard the matter of this new literature, rather than its
geographical distribution, we shall more correctly designate it by the
title Franco-Italian. In the first or Latin period, the Italians used an
ancient language. They now adopted not only the forms but also the
speech of the people from whom they received their literary impulse. It
is probable that the Lombard dialects were still too rough to be
accommodated to the new French style. The cultivated classes were
familiar with Latin, and had felt no need of raising the vernacular
above the bare necessities of intercourse. But the superior social
development of the French courts and castles must be reckoned the main
reason why their language was acclimatized in Italy together with their
literature. Just as the Germans before the age of Herder adopted polite
culture, together with the French tongue, ready-made from France, so now
the Lombard nobles, bordering by the Riviera upon Provence, borrowed
poetry, together with its diction, from the valley of the Rhone. Passing
along the Genoese coast, crossing the Cottian Alps, and following the
valley of the Po, the languages of France and Provence diffused
themselves throughout the North of Italy. With the <i>langue d'o&#239;l</i> came
the Chansons de Geste of the Carolingian Cycle and the romances of the
Arthurian legend. With the <i>langue d'oc</i> came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">-15-</a></span> the various forms of
troubadour lyric. Without displacing the local dialects, these imported
languages were used and spoken purely by the nobles; while a hybrid,
known as <i>franco-italian</i>, sprang up for the common people who listened
to the tales of Roland and Rinaldo on the market-place. The district in
which the whole mass of this foreign literature seems to have flourished
most at first, was the Trevisan March, stretching from the Adige, along
the Po, beyond the Brenta and past Venice, to the base of the Friulian
Alps. The Marches of Treviso were long known as <i>La Marca Amorosa</i> or
<i>Gioiosa</i>, epithets which strongly recall the Proven&#231;al phrases of
<i>Joie</i> and <i>Gai Saber</i>, and which are familiar to English readers of Sir
Thomas Mallory in the name of Lancelot's castle, <i>Joyous Gard</i>. Exactly
to define the period of Trevisan culture would be difficult. It is
probable that it began to flourish about the end of the twelfth, and
declined in the middle of the thirteenth century. Dante alludes to it in
a famous passage of the <i>Purgatory</i><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>:</p>

<p>There are many traces of advanced French civilization in this district,
among which may be mentioned the exhibition of Miracle Plays upon the
French type at Civitale in the years 1298 and 1304, and the <i>Castello
d'Amore</i> at Treviso described by Rolandini in the year 1214. Yet, though
the Trevisan Marches were the nucleus of this Gallicizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">-16-</a></span> fashion, the
use of French and Proven&#231;al spread widely through the North and down
into the center of Italy. Numerous manuscripts in the <i>langue d'o&#239;l</i>
attest the popularity of the Arthurian romances throughout Lombardy, and
we know that in Umbria S. Francis first composed poetry in French.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
It was in French, again, that Brunetto Latini wrote his <i>Tesoro</i>. So
late as the middle of the fourteenth century this habit had not died
out. Dante in the <i>Convito</i> thought it necessary to stigmatize &quot;those
men of perverse mind in Italy who commend the vulgar tongue of
foreigners and depreciate their own.&quot;</p>

<p>We have seen that the language and the matter of this imported
literature were twofold; and we can distinguish two distinct currents,
after its reception into Italy. The Proven&#231;al lyric, as was natural,
attracted the attention of the nobles; and since feudalism had a
stronger hold upon the valley of the Po than on any other district,
Lombardy became the chief home of this poetry. Not to mention the
numerous Proven&#231;al singers who sought fortune and adventure in northern
Italy, about twenty-five Italians, using the <i>langue d'oc</i>, may be
numbered between the Marchese Alberto Malaspina, who held Lunigiana
about 1204, and the Maestro Ferrara, who lived at the Court of Azzo VII.
of Este.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> These were for the most part courtiers and imperial
feudatories; and only two were Tuscans. The person of one of them,
Sordello, is familiar to every reader of the <i>Purgatory</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">-17-</a></span></p><p>The second tide of influence passed from Northern France together with
the epics of chivalry. But its operation was not so simple as that of
the Proven&#231;al lyric. We can trace for instance a marked difference
between the effect produced by the <i>Chansons de Geste</i> and that of the
Arthurian tales. The latter seem to have been appropriated by the
nobles, while the former found acceptance with the people. Nor was this
unnatural. At the opening of the twelfth century the Carolingian Cycle
had begun to lose its vogue among the polished aristocracy of France.
That uncompromising history of warfare hardly suited a society which had
developed the courtesy and the romance of chivalry. It represented the
manners of an antecedent age of feudalism. Therefore the tales of the
Round Table arose to satisfy the needs of knights and ladies, whose
thoughts were turned to love, the chase, the tournament, and errantry.
The Arthurian myth idealized their newer and more refined type of feudal
civility. It was upon the material of this romantic Epic that the nobles
of North Italy fastened with the greatest eagerness. No one has
forgotten how the tragedy of Lancelot and Guinevere proved, in a later
day, the ruin of Francesca and her lover.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The people, on the other
hand, took livelier interest in the songs of Roland and Charlemagne. The
Chansons de Geste formed the stock in trade of those <i>Cantatores
Francigenarum</i>, who crowded the streets and squares of Lombard
cities.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The exchange of courtesies and refined senti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">-18-</a></span>ments between a
Tristram and Iseult or a Lancelot and Guinevere must naturally have been
less attractive to a rude populace than narratives of battle with the
Infidel, and Roland's horn, and Gano's treason, and Rinaldo's quarrels
with his liege. In the Arthurian Cycle names and places alike&#8212;Avalon,
Camelot, Winchester, Gawain, Galahaut&#8212;were distant and ill-adapted to
Italian ears.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The whole tissue of the romance, moreover, was
imaginative. The Carolingian Cycle, on the contrary, introduced
personages with a good right to be considered historical, and dwelt upon
familiar names and traditional ideas. We are not, therefore, surprised
to find that this Epic took a strong hold on the popular imagination,
and so penetrated the Italian race as to assume a new form on Italian
soil, while the Arthurian romance survived as a pastime of the upper
classes, and underwent no important metamorphosis at their hands. In the
course of this volume, I shall have to show how, when Italian literature
emerged again from the people after nearly a century of neglect, it was
the transformed tale of Charlemagne and Roland which supplied the
Italian nation with its master-works of epic poetry&#8212;the <i>Morgante</i> and
the two <i>Orlandos</i>.</p>

<p>The Lombard, or rather the Franco-Italian period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">-19-</a></span> is marked by the
adoption of a foreign language and foreign fashions. Literature at this
stage was exotic and artificial; but the legacy transmitted to the
future was of vast importance. On the one side, the courtly rhymers who
versified in the Proven&#231;al dialect, bequeathed to Sicily and Tuscany the
chivalrous lyric of love, which was destined to take its final and
fairest form from Dante and Petrarch. On the other hand, the populace
who listened to the Song of Roland on the market-place, prepared the
necessary conditions for a specific and eminently characteristic product
of Italian genius. Without a national epic, the Italians were forced to
borrow from the French. But what they borrowed, they transmuted&#8212;not
merely adding new material, like the tale of Gano's treason and the
fiction of Orlando's birth at Sutri, but importing their own spirit,
positive, ironical and incredulous, into the substance of the legend.</p>

<p>In the course of Italianizing the tale of Roland, the native dialects
made their first effort to assume a literary form. We possess sufficient
MS. evidence to prove that the Franco-Italian language of the songs
recited to the Lombard townsfolk, was composed by the adaptation of
local modes of speech to French originals. The process was not one of
pure translation. The dialects were not fit for such performance. It may
rather be described as the attempt of the dialects to acquire capacity
for studied expression. With French poems before them, the popular
rhapsodes introduced dialectical phrases, substituted words, and, where
this was possible, modified the style in favor of the dialect they
wished to use. French still pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">-20-</a></span>dominated. But the hybrid was of such a
nature that a transition from this mixed jargon to the dialect,
presented in a literary shape, was imminent.</p>

<p>There is sufficient ground for presuming that the Italian dialects
triumphed simultaneously in all parts of the peninsula about the middle
of the thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> This presumption is founded partly on the
quotations from dialectical poetry furnished by Dante in the <i>De
Eloquio</i>, which prove a wide-spread literary activity; partly on
fragments recovered from sources which can be referred to the second
half of the century. The peculiar problems offered by the conditions of
poetry at Frederick II.'s Court, though these are open to many
contradictory solutions, render the presumption more than probable. It
is difficult to understand the third or Sicilian period of literature
without hypothesizing an antecedent stage of vulgar poetry produced in
local dialects. But, owing to the scarcity of documents, no positive
facts regarding the date and mode of their emergence can be adduced. We
have on this point to deal with matters of delicate conjecture and
minute inference; and though it might seem logical to introduce at once
a discussion on the growth of the Italian language, and its relation to
the dialects which were undoubtedly spoken before they were committed to
writing, special reasons induce me to defer this topic for the present.</p>

<p>While the North of Italy was deriving the literature both of its
cultivated classes and of the people from France, a new and still more
important phase of evolu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">-21-</a></span>tion was preparing in the South. Both Dante and
Petrarch recognize the Sicilian poets as the first to cultivate the
vulgar tongue with any measure of success, and to raise it to the
dignity of a literary language. In this opinion they not only uttered
the tradition of their age, but were also without doubt historically
correct. Whatever view may be adopted concerning the formation of the
<i>lingua illustre</i>, or polished Italian, from the dialectical elements
already employed in local kinds of poetry, there is no disputing the
importance of the Sicilian epoch. We cannot fix precise dates for its
duration. Yet, roughly speaking, it may be said to have begun in 1166,
when troubadours of some distinction gathered round the person of the
Norman king, William II., at Palermo, and to have ended in 1266, when
Manfred was killed at the battle of Benevento. It culminated during the
reign of the Emperor Frederick II. (1210-1250), who was himself skilled
in Latin and the vulgar tongues of France and Italy, and who drew to his
court men distinguished for their abilities in science and literature.
Dante called Frederick, <i>Cherico grande</i>. The author of the <i>Cento
Novelle</i> described him as <i>veramente specchio del mondo in parlare et in
costumi</i>, and spoke of his capital as the resort of <i>la gente ch'avea
bontade ... sonatori, trovatori, e belli favellatori, uomini d'arti,
giostratori, schermitori, d'ogni maniera gente</i>.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The portrait drawn
of him by Salimbene in his contemporary Chronicle, though highly
unfavorable to the schismatic enemy of Holy Church, proves that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">-22-</a></span>
repute was great in Italy as a patron of letters and himself a poet of
no mean pretensions.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible in these pages to inquire into the views of this great
ruler for the resuscitation of culture in Italy, which, had he not been
thwarted in his policy by the Church, might have anticipated the
Renaissance by two centuries. Yet the opinion may be hazarded that the
cultivation of Italian as a literary language was due in no small
measure to the forethought and deliberate intention of an Emperor, who
preferred his southern to his northern provinces. Unlike the Lombard
nobles, Frederick, while adopting Proven&#231;al literature, gave it Italian
utterance. This seems to indicate both purpose and prevision on his
part. Wishing to found an Italian dynasty, and to acclimatize the
civilization of Provence in his southern capitals, he was careful to
promote purely Italian studies. There can at any rate be no doubt that
during his reign and under his influence very considerable progress was
made towards fixing the diction and the forms of poetry. He found
dialects, not merely spoken, but already adapted to poetical expression,
in more than one district of Italy. From these districts the most
eminent artists flocked to his Court. It was there that a common type of
speech was formed, which, when the burghers of Central Italy began to
emulate the versifiers of Palermo, furnished them with an established
style.</p>

<p>How the <i>lingua aulica</i> came into being admits of much debate. But we
may, I think, maintain that the fundamental dialect from which it sprang
was Sicilian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">-23-</a></span> purified by comparison with Proven&#231;al and Latin, and
largely modified by Apulian elements. The difficulty of understanding
the problem is in part removed when we remember the variety of
representatives from noble towns of Italy who met in Frederick's circle,
the tendencies of a dialect to refine itself when it assumes a literary
form, and the continuous influences of Court-life in common. Italians
gathered round the person of the sovereign at Palermo from their native
cities, must in ordinary courtesy have abandoned the crudities of their
respective idioms. This sacrifice could not but have been reciprocal;
and since Proven&#231;al was not spoken to the exclusion of the
mother-tongue, a generic Italian had here the best chance of
development. That this generic or Court Italian was at root Sicilian, we
have substantial reasons to believe; but that it exactly resembled the
Sicilian of to-day, which does not greatly differ from extant documents
of thirteenth and fourteenth century Sicilian dialect, seems too crude a
supposition.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Unfortunately, our evidence upon this point is
singularly scanty. Few poems of the Sicilian period, as will appear in
the sequel, have descended to us in their primitive form.</p>

<p>Not only was a common language instituted in the Court of Frederick; but
the metrical forms of subsequent Italian poetry were either fixed or
suggested by the practice of these early versifiers. Few subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">-24-</a></span> are
involved in darker obscurity than the history of meters&#8212;the creation of
rhythmical structures whereby one national literature distinguishes
itself from another.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Just as each writer who can claim an individual
style seems to possess his own rhythm, his peculiar tune, to which his
sentences are cadenced, so each nation appropriates and adheres to its
own meter. The Italian hendecasyllabic, the French Alexandrian, the
English heroic iambic, are obvious examples. This selection of a
characteristic meter, and the essays through which the race arrives at
its perfection, seem to imply some instinct, planted within the deeps of
national personality, whereof the laws have not been formulated. When we
speak of the genius of a language, we do but personify this instinct,
which appears to exercise itself at an early period of national
development, leaving for subsequent centuries the task of refining and
completing what had been projected at the outset. Therefore, nothing
very distinct can be asserted about the origin of the hendecasyllable
iambic line, which marks Italian poetry.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Yet it certainly appears
among <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">-25-</a></span>the early specimens of the Sicilian period. The rhyming system of
the octave stanza may possibly be traced in Ciullo d'Alcamo's <i>tenzone</i>
between the lover and his mistress; though it still needed a century of
elaboration at the hands of popular <i>rispetti</i>-writers, to present it in
completed form to Boccaccio's muse.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This poem is Alexandrine in
rhythm. <i>Terza rima</i> seems to be suggested by the sonnet of the
<i>Sparviere</i>; while a perfect sonnet, differing very little either in
structure or in diction from the type of Petrarch's, is supplied in
Piero delle Vigne's <i>Perocch&#232; amore</i>. At the same time the highwrought
structure of the <i>Canzone</i>, destined to play so triumphant a part during
the whole period of the <i>trecento</i>, receives its essential outlines from
the rhymers of this age, especially from Jacopo da Lentino and Guido
delle Colonne.</p>

<p>Though the forms and language of Sicilian poetry decided the destinies
of Italian, the substance of this literature was far from being
national. Under its Italian garb, it was no less an exotic than the
Proven&#231;al and French compositions of the Lombard period. After running a
brilliant course in Provence, the poetry of chivalrous love was now
declining to its decadence. It had ceased to be the spontaneous
expression of a dominant ideal, and had degenerated into a pastime for
<i>dilettanti</i>. Its style had become conventional; its phrases fixed. The
visionary science upon which it was based, had to be studied in codes of
doctrine and repeated with pedantic precision. Frederick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">-26-</a></span> and his
courtiers received it at the point of its extinction. They adhered as
closely as possible to traditional forms, imitated time-honored models,
and confined their efforts to the reproduction of the old art in a new
vehicle of language. Therefore, vernacular Italian poetry in this first
stage of its existence presents the curious spectacle of literature
decrepit in the cradle, hampered with the euphuism of an exhausted
manner before it could move freely, and taught to frame conceits and
cold antitheses before it learned to lisp.</p>

<p>Such, in general, may be said to have been the character of the Sicilian
or Italo-Proven&#231;al style. Yet a careful student of these Canzoni,
Serventesi, and Tenzoni, will discover much that is both natural and
graceful, much that is elevated in thought, much again that belongs to
the crude sensuousness of Southern temperament. There is an unmistakable
blending of the Proven&#231;al tradition with indigenous realism, especially
in such compositions as the Lament of Odo delle Colonne, the Lament of
Ruggieri Pugliese, and the <i>Tenzone</i> of Ciullo d'Alcamo.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> We can
trace a double current of inspiration: the one passing downward from the
learned writers of the Court, the judges, notaries, and men of state,
who followed Proven&#231;al tradition; the other upward from the people, who
rhymed as nature taught them: both mingling in the compositions of those
more genial poets, who were able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">-27-</a></span> infuse reality into the labored
form of their adoption. What might have been the destiny of Italian
literature, if the Suabian House had maintained its hold on the Two
Sicilies, and this process of fusion had been completed at Naples or
Palermo, cannot even be surmised.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the earliest Italo-Proven&#231;al poetry is vague, owing to
lack of genuine Sicilian monuments. We can only trace faint indications
of a progress toward greater freedom and more spontaneous inspiration,
as the &quot;courtly makers&quot; yielded to the singers of the people. The battle
of Benevento extinguished at one blow both the hopes of the Suabian
dynasty and the development of Sicilian poetry. When Manfred's body had
been borne naked on a donkey from the battle-field to his nameless
grave, amid the cries of <i>Chi compra Manfredi?</i> a foreign troubadour,
Amerigo di Peguilhan, composed his lament, bidding the <i>serventese</i> pass
through all lands and over every sea to find the man who knew where
Arthur dwelt and when he would return. Arthur was dead, and would never
come again. Chivalry and feudalism had held their brief and feeble sway
in Italy, and that was over. Neither in Lombardy among the castles, nor
in Sicily within the Court, throbbed the real life of the Italian
nation. That life was in the Communes. It beat in the heart of the
people&#8212;especially of that people who had made nobility a crime beside
the Arno, and had outlawed the <i>Scioperati</i> from their City of the
Flower. What the Suabian princes gave to Italy was the beginning of a
common language. It remained for Tuscany to stamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">-28-</a></span> that language with
her image and superscription, to fix it in its integrity for all future
ages, and to render it the vehicle of stateliest science and consummate
art.</p>

<p>The question of the origin of the Italian language pertains rather to
philology than to the history of culture.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Yet I cannot pass it
wholly by in silence, since it was raised at an early period by the
founders of Italian literature, who occupied themselves with singular
sagacity concerning the relations of the literary to the dialectical
forms of speech. Dante's <i>De Eloquio</i>, though based on unscientific
principles of analysis, opened a discussion which exercised the acutest
intellects of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>During the whole Roman period, it is certain that literary Latin
differed in important respects from the vulgar, rustic or domestic,
language. Thus while a Roman gentleman would have said <i>habeo pulchrum
equum</i>, his groom probably expressed the same thought in words like
these: <i>ego habeo unum bellum caballum</i>. Between a <i>graffito</i> scribbled
on the wall of some old Roman building&#8212;<i>Alexander unum animal est</i>, for
instance&#8212;and one now chalked in the same district, <i>Alessandro &#232; un
animale</i>, there is hardly as much difference as between a literary Latin
sentence and either of these rustic epigrams; while the use of such
intensitives as <i>multum</i> and <i>bene</i>, to express the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">-29-</a></span> superlative degree,
indicate in vulgar Latin the presence of a principle alien to literary
Latin but sympathetic to modern speech. The vulgar or rustic Latin
continued, side by side with its literary counterpart, throughout the
middle ages, forming in the first centuries of imperial decline the
common speech of the Romance peoples, and gradually assuming those
specific forms which determined the French, Spanish, and Italian types.
There is little doubt that, could we possess ourselves of sufficient
documents, we should be able to trace the stages in this process. Both
literary and vulgar Latin suffered transformation&#8212;the former declining
in purity, variety, and vigor; the latter diverging dialectically into
the constituents of the three grand families of modern Latin. But the
metamorphosis was not of the same nature in both cases. While the
literary language had been fixed, arrested, and delivered over to death,
the vulgar tongue retained a vivid and assimilative life, capable of
biological transmutation. French, Spanish, and Italian are modes of its
existence continued under laws of organic variety and change.</p>

<p>It would be unscientific to suppose that rustic Latin, even in the most
flourishing period of the Roman Empire, was identical in all provinces.
From the first it must have held within itself the principles of
differentiation. And when we consider the varying conditions of soil,
climate, ethnological admixture and political development in the several
regions of the Roman world, together with the divers influences of
contiguous or invasive races, we shall form some notion of the process
by which the three languages in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">-30-</a></span> question branched off from the common
stock of rustic Latin.</p>

<p>The same laws of differentiation hold good with regard to the dialects
in each of these new languages. It is improbable that absolutely the
same vulgar Latin was at any epoch spoken in two remote districts of the
same province&#8212;on the Tuscan sea-coast, for example, and on the banks of
Padus. Even when the Roman empire used one language, intelligible from
the &#198;gean to the German Ocean, the Italic districts must have differed
in their local vernacular. Again, the same conditions (climatic,
ethnological, political, and so forth) which helped to determine the
generic distinctions of French, Spanish, and Italian, determined also
the specific distinctions of one Italian dialect from another. Those of
the north-west, for instance, inclined to Gallic, and those of the
north-east to Illyrian idiom. Those of Lombardy in general exhibit a
mixture of German words. Those of Sicily and the south approximate more
to a Spanish type, and share the effects of Greek and Arab occupation.
The dialects of the center, especially the Tuscan, show marked
superiority both in grammatical form and phonetic purity over the more
disintegrated and corrupted idioms of north and south. It might be
suggested that Tuscan, being less modified by foreign contact, continued
the natural life of the old rustic Latin according to laws of unimpeded
self-development. But, however we may attempt to explain this problem,
the fact remains that, while the Italian dialects present affinities
which show them to be of one linguistic family, it is Tuscan that
completes and inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">-31-</a></span>prets them collectively. Tuscan stands to Italian in
the same relation as Castilian to Spanish, or the speech of the Ile de
France to French. It is a dialect, but a dialect that realized the bent
and striving of the language. We find it difficult to feel, far more to
state, what qualities in a dialect and in the people of the district who
use it, render one idiom more adapted to literary usage, more
characteristic of the language it helps to constitute, more plastic and
expressive of national peculiarities, than those around it. But the fact
is certain that this superiority in Tuscan was early recognized;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and
that too without any political advantages in favor of its triumph.
Boniface VIII. unconsciously expressed, perhaps, the truth, when he
called the Florentines <i>il quinto elemento</i>. It was something
spiritually quintessential, something complementary to the sister
dialects, which caused the success of Tuscan.</p>

<p>Thus, while literary Latin, though dying and almost dead, was taught in
the grammar schools and used by learned men, the rustic Latin in the
thirteenth century had disappeared. But this disappearance was not
death. It was transformation. The group of dialects which represented
the new phase in its existence, shared such common qualities as proved
them to have had original affinity; and fitted them for being recognized
as a single family. The position, therefore, of the Italians at the
close of the thirteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">-32-</a></span> century with regard to language, was this. They
possessed the classic Latin authors in a bad state of preservation, and
studied a few of them with some minuteness, basing their own learned
style upon the imitation of Virgil and Ovid, Cicero, Boethius, and the
rhetoricians of the lower empire. But at home, in their families, upon
the market-place, and in the prosecution of business, they talked the
local dialects, each of which was more or less remotely representative
of the ancient vulgar Latin. However these dialects might differ, they
formed in combination a new language, distinct from the parent stock of
Rustic Latin, and equally distinct from French and Spanish.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Whatever
difficulty an Italian of Calabria or Friuli might have felt in
understanding the <i>Divine Comedy</i>, he would have recognized an element
in its diction which defined it from French or Spanish, and marked it
out as proper to his mother-tongue. If this was true of the refined type
of Tuscan used by a great master, it was no less true of dialectical
compositions selected for the express purpose of exhibiting their
rudeness. Dante clearly expected contemporary readers not only to
interpret, but to appreciate the shades of greater and lesser nicety in
the examples he culled from Roman, Apulian, Florentine and other
vernacular literatures. This expectation proves that he felt himself to
be dealing with a group of dialects which, taken collectively, formed a
common idiom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">-33-</a></span> In these circumstances it was the problem of writers, at
the close of the thirteenth century, to construct the ideal vulgar
tongue, to discover its capacities for noble utterance, to refine it for
artistic usage by the omission of cruder elements existing in each
dialect, and to select from those store-houses of living speech the
phrases which appeared well suited to graceful utterance. The
desideratum, to use Dante's words, was &quot;that illustrious, cardinal,
courtly, curial mother-tongue, proper to each Italian State, special to
none, whereby the local idioms of every city are to be measured,
weighed, and compared.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Dante saw that this selection of a literary
language from the fresh shoots sent up by the antique vulgar Latin stock
could best be accomplished in a capital or Court, the meeting-place of
learned people and polished intelligences. But such a metropolis of
culture, corresponding to Elizabeth's London or the Paris of Louis XIV.,
was ever wanting in Italy. &quot;We have no Court,&quot; he says: &quot;and yet the
members that should compose a Court are not absent.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He refers to
men of education and good manners, upon whom, in the absence of a local
center of refinement, fell the duty of reforming the vernacular. The
peculiar conditions of Italy, as he described them, were destined to
subsist throughout the next two centuries and a half, when men of
learning, taking Tuscan as their standard, sought by practice and
example to form a national language. The self-consciousness of the
Italians front to front with this problem, as revealed to us in the
pages of the <i>De Eloquio</i>, and the decision with which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">-34-</a></span>the great
authors of the fourteenth century fixed a certain type of diction,
accurately spoken nowhere, though nearer to the Tuscan than to any other
idiom, may be reckoned among the most interesting phenomena in the
history of literature. Tuscan predominated; but that the masterpieces of
the <i>trecento</i> were not composed in any one of the unadulterated Tuscan
dialects is clear, not merely from the contemporary testimony of Dante
himself, but also from the obstinate discussions raised upon this
subject by Bembo at a later period. A guiding and controlling principle
of taste determined the instinctive method of selection whereby Tuscan
was adapted to the common needs of Italy.</p>

<p>While treating of the Latin, the Lombard or Franco-Italian, and the
Sicilian or Italo-Proven&#231;al periods of national development, I have
hitherto neglected that plebeian literature which, although its
monuments have almost perished, must have been diffused in dialects
through Italy after the opening of the thirteenth century. Written for
and by the people, the relics of this prose and poetry are valuable, not
merely for the light they throw on the formation of language, but also
for their indications of national tendencies. In the northern dialects
we meet with treatises of religious, ethical and gnomic import, among
which the <i>Gerusalemme Celeste</i> and <i>Babilonia Infernale</i> of Fra
Giacomino of Verona, the Bible History of Pietro Bescap&#232; of Milan, the
Contention between Satan and the Virgin of Bonvesin da Riva, and two
other dialogues by the same author, one between the Soul and Body, the
other between a son and his father in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">-35-</a></span> hell, deserve mention. To this
class again belongs Bonvesin's <i>Cinquanta Cortesie da Tavola</i>, a book of
etiquette adapted to the needs of the small <i>bourgeoisie</i> upon their
entrance into social life.</p>

<p>It is impossible to fix even an approximate date for the emergence of
Italian prose. Law documents, deeds of settlement, contracts, and public
acts, which can be referred with certainty to the first half of the
thirteenth century, display a pressure of the vulgar speech upon the
formal Latin of official verbiage. The effort to obtain precision in
designating some particular locality or some important person, forces
the scribe back upon his common speech; and these evidences of
difficulty in wielding the Latin which had now become a dying language,
prove that, long before it was written, Italian was spoken. From the
year 1231 we possess accounts of domestic expenditure written by one
Mattasal&#224; di Spinello dei Lambertini in the Sienese dialect. Then follow
Lucchese documents and letters of Sienese citizens, which, though they
have no literary value, show that people who could write had begun to
express their thoughts in spoken idiom. The first essays in Italian
composition for a lettered public were translations from works already
written by Italians in <i>langue d'o&#239;l</i>. Among these a prominent place
must be assigned to the version of Marco Polo's travels, which
Rusticiano of Pisa first published in French, having possibly received
them in Venetian from the traveler's own lips. The <i>Tesoro</i> of Brunetto
Latini and Egidio's <i>De Regimine Principum</i> were Italianized in this
way; while numerous digests of Frankish romances, including the
collection known as <i>Conti di antichi Cavalieri</i>, appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">-36-</a></span> to meet the
same popular demand. Religious history and ethics furnished another
library in the vernacular. The <i>Dodici Conti Morali</i>, the <i>Introduzione
alle Virt&#249;</i>, the <i>Giardino della Consolazione</i>, and the <i>Libra di Cato</i>
supplied the people with specimens from works already famous. After a
like manner, books of rhetoric and grammar in vogue among the medieval
students were popularized in abstracts for Italian readers. We may cite
a version of Orosius, and a <i>Fiore di Retorica</i> based upon the <i>Ad
Herennium</i> and Cicero. Of scientific compilations, the <i>Composizione del
Mondo</i> by Ristoro of Arezzo, embracing astronomical and geographical
information, takes rank with the ethical and rhetorical works already
mentioned. The note of all these compositions is that they are
professedly epitomes of learning, already possessed in more authentic
sources by scholars. As such, they prove that there existed a class of
readers eager for instruction, to whom books written in Latin or in
French were not accessible. In a word, they indicate the advent of the
modern tongue, with all its exigencies and with all its capabilities. To
deal with the Chronicles of this period is no easy matter; for those
which are professedly the oldest&#8212;Matteo Spinelli's Ricordano
Malespini's, and <i>Lu Ribellamentu di Sicilia</i>&#8212;have been proved in some
sense fabrications. On the other hand, it is clear from the <i>Cento
Novelle</i> that the more dramatic episodes of history and myth were being
submitted to the same epitomizing treatment. Finally we have to mention
Guittone of Arezzo's epistles as the first serious attempt to treat the
vulgar tongue rhetorically, for a distinct literary purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">-37-</a></span></p>

<p>From the dry records of incipient prose it is refreshing to turn to
another species of popular poetry; for poetry in the period of origins
is always more adult than prose. Numerous fragments of political songs
have been disinterred from chronicles, which can be referred to the
thirteenth century. Thus an anonymous Genoese rhymster celebrated the
victories of Laiazzo (1294) and Curzola (1298), while Giovanni Villani
preserved six lines upon the siege of Messina (1282).<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Verses in the
vulgar tongue commemorating the apostasy of Fra Elia, General of the
Franciscans, in 1240, and the coming of the Florentine Lambertesco dei
Lamberteschi as Podest&#224; to Reggio in 1243, with scraps of song relating
to Pisan and Florentine history, may be read in Carducci's monumental
work upon this period of literature.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> These relics, though precious,
are singularly scanty; nor can a Northern student pass them by without
remarking the absence of that semi-historical, semi-mythical poetry,
which is so familiar to us under the name of Ballad. More important,
because of greater extent, are the laments and amorous or comic poems,
which can be attributed to the same century. The Lament of the Paduan
woman for her husband, who has journeyed to Holy Land in the Crusade
preached by Urban IV., may be compared with Rinaldo d'Aquino's
Farewell.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Both of these compositions were written under Proven&#231;al
influence, though the former at least is strictly dialectical and
popular. Passing to satirical poems, I may mention <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">-38-</a></span>two pieces extracted
from a Bolognese MS. of 1272 which paint with vivid force of humor the
manners of women.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> One represents a drinking-party of more than
Aristophanic freedom; the other, a wrangling match between two
sisters-in-law&#8212;the <i>Cognate</i>. Each displays facility of composition and
a literary style already formed. They are not without French parallels;
but the mode of presentation is Italian, and the phrases have been
transplanted without change from vulgar dialogue. Two romantic lyrics
extracted from the same MS. prove that the fashionable style of Provence
had descended from the nobles to the common folk and taken a new
tincture of realism.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The complaint of an unwedded maiden to her
mother is a not uncommon motive in this early literature, turning either
to pathos or suggesting a covert coarseness in the climax.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> To the
same class may be referred some graceful lyrics and dance-songs,
combining the artlessness of popular inspiration with reminiscences of
French originals.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Of these the Nightingale and the Song of Love in
Dreams might be selected for their close sympathy with the <i>rispetti</i>
made in Italian country districts at the present day. Lastly, I have to
mention two obscene poems of great popularity, <i>Il Nicchio</i> and
<i>L'Ugellino</i>.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> These were known to Boccaccio, for he refers to them
by name at the close of the fifth day in the Decameron. Each of the
ditties bears a thoroughly Italian stamp, and anticipates by its
peculiar style of <i>double entendre</i> a whole department of national
poetry&#8212;the Florentine Carnival <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">-39-</a></span>Songs and the Capitoli of the Roman
academies being distinctly foreshadowed in their humorous and allusive
treatment of a vulgar topic. Hence we may take occasion to observe that
those who accuse Lorenzo de' Medici and his contemporaries of debasing
popular taste by the deliberate introduction of licentiousness into art,
exceed the limits of just censure. What is called the Paganism of the
Renaissance, was indigenous in Italy. We find it inherent in vulgar
literature before the date of Boccaccio; and if, with the advance of
social luxury, it assumed, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a
more objectionable prominence, this should not be exclusively ascribed
to the influence of humanistic studies or to the example of far-sighted
despots. Indeed, it can be asserted that the specific quality of the
popular Italian genius&#8212;its sensuous realism, qualified with
irony&#8212;emerges unmistakably in five most important relics of the
thirteenth century, the <i>Cognate</i>, the <i>Comadri</i>, the Tenzone of the
Maiden and her Mother (<i>Mamma lo temp'&#232; venuto</i>), the <i>Nicchio</i>, and the
<i>Ugellino</i>.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> They yield the common stuff of that magnificent art
which shall afterwards be developed into the <i>Decameron</i> and the
<i>Novelle</i>, out of which shall proceed the comedies and Bernesque lyrics
of the <i>Cinque Cento</i>, and which is destined to penetrate the golden
cantos of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">-40-</a></span> <i>Orlando Furioso</i>. To an unprejudiced student of Italian
arts and letters nothing seems more clearly proved than the fact that a
certain powerful objective quality&#8212;call it realism, call it
sensuousness&#8212;determines their most genuine productions, sinking to
grossness, ascending to sublimity, combining with religious feeling in
the fine arts, blending with the definiteness of classic style, but
never absent. It is this objectivity, realism, sensuousness, which
constitutes the strength of the Italians, and assigns the limitations of
their faculty.</p>

<p>In quite a different region, but of no less importance for the future of
Italian literature, must be reckoned the religious hymns, which, during
the thirteenth century, began to be composed in the vernacular. The
earliest known specimen is S. Francis' famous <i>Cantico del Sole</i>, which,
even as it is preserved to us, after undergoing the process of
modernization, retains the purity and freshness of a bird's note in
spring. After S. Francis, but at the distance of half a century,
followed Jacopone da Todi, with his passionate and dithyrambic odes,
which seem to vibrate tongues of fire. To this religious lyric the
Flagellant frenzy (1260) and the subsequent formation of Companies of
Laudesi gave decisive impulse. I shall have in a future chapter to
discuss the relation between the Umbrian Lauds and the origins of the
Drama. It is enough here to notice the part played in the evolution of
the language by so early a transition from the Latin Hymns of the Church
to Hymns written in the modern speech for private confraternities and
domestic gatherings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">-41-</a></span></p>

<p>We learn from this meager review of ancient popular poetry that during
the thirteenth century the dialects of each district had begun to seek
literary expression. There are many indications that the products of one
province speedily became the property of the rest. Spontaneous motives
were mingled with French and Proven&#231;al recollections; and already we can
trace the unconscious effort to form a common language in the process
known as <i>Toscaneggiamento</i>, or the translation of local songs into
Tuscan idiom.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It would, therefore, be incorrect to imagine either
that the Sicilian poets were blank imitators of Proven&#231;al models, or
that the Italian language started into being at Palermo. What really
happened was, that Frederick's Court became the center of a widespread
literary movement. The Sicilian dialect predominating at Palermo over
the rest, the poets of different provinces who assembled round the
Emperor were subsequently known as Sicilian. Their songs, passing upward
through the peninsula, bore that name, even when they had, as at
Florence, been converted, by dialectical modifications, to the use of
Tuscan folk.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The aristocratic tone of the Court made Proven&#231;al
literature fashionable; and a refined diction, softening the crudities
of more than one competing dialect, was formed to express the subtleties
of the Proven&#231;al style. We must bear in mind that the poets of this
Court <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">-42-</a></span>were men of learned education&#8212;judges, notaries, officials. Dante
makes <i>dottori</i> nearly synonymous with <i>trovatori</i>. At the same time,
one of the earliest specimens of Sicilian poetry, Ciullo d'Alcamo's
<i>Tenzone</i>, is popular, free from Proven&#231;al affectation, inclining to
comedy in some of its marked motives and to coarseness at its close.
This proves that in the island, side by side with &quot;courtly makers&quot; and
<i>dottori</i>, there flourished an original and vulgar manner of poetry.</p>

<p>The process of Tuscanization referred to in the preceding paragraph is
too important in its bearings on the problems of Italian language and
literature, to be passed over without further discussion. Nearly all the
poetry of the Sicilian epoch has been transmitted to us in Florentine
MSS., after undergoing <i>Toscaneggiamento</i>. We possess but a few stanzas
in a pure condition. There is, therefore, reason to believe that when
Dante treated of the courtly Sicilian poets in his essay <i>De Vulgari
Eloquio</i>, he knew their writings in a form already Tuscanized.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In
commending the curial and illustrious vernacular, as something distinct
from the dialects, he was in truth praising the dialect of his own
province, refined by the practice of polite versifiers. At the date of
the composition of that essay, the Suabian House had been extinguished;
the literary society of the south was broken up; and to Florence had
already fallen the heritage of art. What is even more remarkable, the
Bolognese poets, who preceded Dante and his peers by one generation, had
abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">-43-</a></span> their own dialect in favor of the purified Tuscan.
Consequently the new Italian literature was already Tuscan either by
origin, or by adoption, or by a process of transformation, before the
Florentines assumed the dictatorship of letters. It seems paradoxical to
hint that Dante should not have perceived what has been here stated as
more than a mere possibility. How came it that he included Florentine
among the peccant idioms, and maintained that the true literary speech
was still to seek? These doubts may in part at least be removed, when we
remember the peculiar conditions under which the courtly poetry he
praised had been produced; and the indirect channels by which it had
reached him. In the first place, we have seen that it was composed in
avowed imitation of Proven&#231;al models, by men of taste and learning drawn
from several provinces. They culled, for literary purposes, a vocabulary
of colorless and neutral words, which clothed the same conventional
ideas with elegant and artificial monotony. When these compositions
underwent the further process of Tuscanization (which was easy, owing to
certain dialectical affinities between Sicilian and Tuscan), they lost
to a large extent what still remained to them of local character,
without acquiring the true stamp of Florentine. Even a contemporary
could not have recognized in the verse of Jacopo da Lentino, thus
treated, either a genuine Sicilian or a genuine Tuscan flavor. His
language presented the appearance of being, as indeed it was, different
from both idioms. The artifice of style made it pass for superior; and,
in purely literary quality, it was in truth superior to the products of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">-44-</a></span>
plebeian inspiration. We may prefer the racy stanzas of the <i>Cognate</i> to
those frigid and exhausted euphuisms. But the critical taste of so great
a master as even Dante was not tuned to any such preference. Though he
recognized the defects of the Sicilian poets, as is manifest from his
dialogue with Guido in the <i>Purgatory</i>, he gave them all credit for
elevating verse above the vulgar level. Their insipid diction seemed to
him the first germ of a noble <i>lingua aulica</i>. Its colorlessness and
strangeness hid the fact that it had already, at the close of the
thirteenth century, assumed the Tuscan habit, and that from the
well-springs of Tuscan idiom the Italian of the future would have to
draw its aliment.</p>

<p>The downfall of the Hohenstauffens and the dispersion of their
Court-poets proved a circumstance of decisive benefit to Italian
literature, by removing it from a false atmosphere into conditions where
it freely flourished and expanded its originality. Feudalism formed no
vital part of the Italian social system, and chivalry had never been
more than an exotic, cultivated in the hotbed of the aristocracy. The
impulse given to poetry in the south, under influences in no true sense
of the phrase national&#8212;a Norman-German dynasty attempting to
acclimatize Proven&#231;al forms upon Italian soil&#8212;could hardly have
produced a vigorous type of literature. It is from the people, in
centers of popular activity, or where the spirit of the people finds
full play in representative society, that characteristic art must be
developed. When we say this, we think inevitably of Periclean Athens,
Elizabeth's London, the Paris of Louis XIV. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">-45-</a></span> chances of our drama
had been confined to Court-patronage or Sidney's Areopagus, instead of
being extended to the nation by free competition in the wooden theaters
where Marlowe and Shakspere appealed to popular taste, there is little
doubt but that England would only have boasted of a mediocre and
academical stage. When Italian poetry deserted Palermo for the banks of
the Arno, it exchanged the Court for the people; the subtleties of
decadent chivalry for the genuine impulses of a free community; the
pettiness of culture for the humanities of a public conscious of high
destinies and educated in a masculine political arena. Here the grand
qualities of the Italian genius found an open field. Literature,
abandoning imitative elegance, expressed the feelings, thoughts, and
aspirations of a breed second to none in Europe for acuteness of
intellect, intensity of emotion, and greatness of purpose. At Palermo
the princes and their courtiers had been reciprocally auditors and
poets. At Florence the people listened; and the poets, sprung from them,
were speakers. Except at Athens in the golden age of Hellas, no populace
has equaled that of Florence both for the production of original genius,
and also for the sensitiveness to beauty, diffused throughout all
classes, which brings the artist and his audience into right accord.</p>

<p>Two stages in the transition from Sicily to Florence need to be
described. Guittone of Arezzo (1230-1294) strikes the historian of
literature as the man who first attempted to nationalize the polished
poetry of the Sicilian Court, and to strip the new style of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">-46-</a></span> feudal
pedantry.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It was his aim, apparently, dismissing chivalrous
conventions, to use the diction and the forms of literary art in an
immediate appeal to the Italian people. He wrote, however, roughly.
Though he practiced vernacular prose, and assumed in verse the
declamatory tone which Petrarch afterwards employed with such effect in
his addresses to the consciousness of Italy, yet Dante could speak of
him with cold contempt<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>; nor can we claim for him a higher place than
that of precursor. He attempted more than he was able to fulfill. But
his attempt, when judged by the conditions of his epoch, deserves to
rank among achievements.</p>

<p>With a poet of Bologna the case is different. Placed midway between
Lombardy and Tuscany, Bologna shared the instincts of the two noblest
Italian populations&#8212;the Communes who wrested liberty from Frederick
Barbarossa, and the Communes who were to give arts and letters to the
nation. Bologna, moreover, was proud of her legal university, and had
already won her title of &quot;the learned.&quot; Here Guido Guinicelli solved the
problem of rendering the Sicilian style at once national in spirit and
elevated in style.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> He did so by making it scientific. Receiving from
his Italo-Proven&#231;al predecessors the material of chivalrous love, and
obeying the genius of his native city, Guido rhymed of love no longer as
a fashionable pastime, but as the medium of philosophic truth. Learning
was the mother of the national Italian <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">-47-</a></span>poetry. From Guido started a
school of transcendental singers, who used the ancient form and
subject-matter of exotic poetry for the utterance of metaphysical
thought. The Italians, born, as it were, old, were destined thus to pass
from imitation, through speculation, to the final freedom of their
sensuous art. Of this new lyric style&#8212;logical, allegorical,
mystical&#8212;the first masterpiece was Guido's Canzone of the Gentle Heart.
The code was afterwards formulated in Dante's <i>Convito</i>. The life it
covered and interpreted was painted in the <i>Vita Nuova</i>. Its apocalypse
was the <i>Paradiso</i>. If Guido Guinicelli did not succeed in writing from
the heart, if he was more of an analyst than a lover, it is yet clear
that the euphuisms of the Italo-Proven&#231;al imitators have yielded in his
verse to genuine emotion, while, speaking technically, the complex
structure of the true Italian Canzone now appears in all its harmony of
grace and grandeur. Guido's language is Tuscan; not the Tuscan of the
people, but the Tuscan of the Toscaneggiamenti. Herein, again, we note
the importance of this poet in the history of literature. Working
outside Florence, but obeying Florentine precedent, he stamps Italian
with a Tuscan seal, and helps to conceal from Tuscans themselves the
high destinies of their idiom.</p>

<p>Dante puts us at the right point of view for estimating Guido's service.
Though he recognized the Sicilians as the first masters of poetic style
in Italy, Dante saluted the poet of Bologna as his father<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">-48-</a></span></p>

</table>

<p>On the authority of this sentence we hail in Guido the founder of the
new and specifically national literature of the Italians. If not the
master, he was the prophet of that <i>dolce stil nuovo</i>, which freed them
from dependence on foreign traditions, and led, by transmutation, to the
miracles of their Renaissance art. He divined that sincere source of
inspiration, whereof Dante speaks<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>:</p>

<p>The happy instinct which led him to use Tuscan, has secured his place
upon the roll of poets who may still be read with pleasure. And of this,
too, Dante prophesied<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>:</p>

<p>Bologna could boast of many minor bards&#8212;of the excellent Onesto, of
Fabrizio and Ghislieri, <i>qui doctores fuerunt illustres et vulgarium
discretione repleti</i>.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Her erudition was further illustrated by the
work of one Guidotto, who composed a treatise on the new vernacular,
which he dedicated to King Manfred. Thus both by example and precept, by
the testimony of Dante and the fair fame of her own writers, this city
makes for us a link between Sicilian and Tuscan literature.</p>

<p>Manfred was slain at Benevento in 1266, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">-49-</a></span>with him expired the
prospects of Sicilian poetry. Dante, destined to inaugurate the great
age, was born at Florence in 1265. Guido Guinicelli died in 1277, when
Dante had completed his twelfth year. From 1249 until 1271, during the
whole childhood of Dante, Enzo, King of Sardinia, Manfred's half-brother
and Frederick II.'s son, remained a prisoner in the public palace of
Bologna. In one of those years of preparation and transition, while the
learned stanzas of Guido Guinicelli were preluding the &quot;new sweet style&quot;
of Tuscany, this yellow-haired scion of the Suabian princes, the
progenitor of the Bentivogli, sent a song forth from his dungeon's
<i>loggie</i> to greet the provinces of Italy:&#8212;</p>

<p>These lines sound a farewell to the old age and a salutation to the new.
Enzo's heart is in the lowlands of Apulia and the great Capitanate,
where his father built castles and fought mighty wars. He belongs, like
his verses, like his race, like the chivalrous sentiments he had imbibed
in youth, to the past; and now he is dreaming life away, a captive with
the burghers of Bologna. Yet it is Tuscany for which he reserves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">-50-</a></span>
epithet of Sovereign&#8212;Tuscany where all courtesy holds sway. The
situation is pathetic. The poem is a prophecy.</p>

<p>Raimond of Tours, one of the earlier French minnesingers, bade his
friend seek hospitality &quot;in the noble city of the Florentines, named
Florence; for it is there that joy and song and love are perfected with
beauty crowned.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The delicate living and graceful pastimes of
Valdarno were famous throughout Europe. In the old French romance of
&quot;Cl&#233;omad&#233;s,&quot; for example, we read a rhymed description of the games and
banquets with which Florence welcomed May and June<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>:&#8212;</p>

<p>Villani, writing of the year 1283, when the Guelfs had triumphed and the
nobles had been quelled, speaks thus of those festivities<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>:&#8212;&quot;In this
happy and fair state of ease and peaceful quiet so wealth-giving to
merchants and artificers, and specially to the Guelfs, who ruled the
land, there was formed in the quarter of S. Felicit&#224; beyond the Arno,
where the family De' Rossi took the lead, together with their
neighborhood, a company or band of one thousand men and upwards, all
attired in white, with a Lord named the Lord of Love. This band had no
other purpose than to pass the time in games and solace, and in dances
of ladies, knights and other people of the city, roaming the town with
trumpets and divers instruments of music, in joy <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">-51-</a></span>and gladness, and
abiding together in banquets at mid-day and eventide.&quot; From another
chronicle it appears that this company was called the <i>Brigata bianca</i>,
or <i>Brigata amorosa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> &quot;There,&quot; says a rhymer who had seen the
sports, &quot;might one behold the rich attire of silk and gold, of samite,
white and blue and violet, with fair velvets; and trappings of all
colors I beheld that day. The young men mid the women went with gaze
fixed upon those eyes angelical, that turn the midnight into noon. Over
their blonde tresses the maidens wore gems and precious garlands;
lilies, violets and roses were their charming faces. You would not have
said: 'Yon are mortal beings.' They rather seemed a thousand
paradises.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The amusements lasted two months, from May 1 until the end of the
midsummer feast of S. John, patron of Florence. Later on, we read of two
companies, the one dressed in yellow, the other in white, each led by
their King, who filled the city with the sound of music, and wore
garlands on their heads, and spent their time in dances and
banquets.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Again, when the nobles, after the battle of Campaldino, had been finally
suppressed, Villani once more returns to the subject of these companies,
describing the booths of wood adorned with silken curtains, which were
ranged along the streets and squares, for the accommodation of
guests.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It will be observed that Villani connects the gladness of
this season with the successive triumphs of the Guelf party and the
suppression of the nobles by the Popolo. Not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">-52-</a></span>only was Florence freed
from grave anxieties and heavy expenses, caused by the intramural
quarrels between Counts and Burghers, but the city felt the advent of
her own prosperity, the realization of her true type, in their
victorious close. Then the new noble class, the <i>popolani grassi</i>,
assumed the gentle manners of chivalry, accommodating its customs to
their own rich jovial ideal. Feudalism was extinguished; but society
retained such portions of feudal customs as shed beauty upon common
life. Tranquillity succeeded to strife, and the medieval city presented
a spectacle similar to that which an old Greek lyrist has described
among the gifts of Peace:</p>

<p>Goro di Stagio Dati, writing at the end of the fourteenth century, has
preserved for us an animated picture of Florence in May.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> &quot;When the
season of spring appears to gladden all the world, every man bethinks
him how to make fair the day of S. John, which follows at midsummer, and
there is none but provides himself betimes with clothes and ornaments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">-53-</a></span>
and jewels. Marriages and other joyous occasions are deferred until that
time, to do the festival honor; and two months before the date, they
begin to furnish forth the decorations of the races&#8212;dresses of varlets,
banners, clarions, draperies, and candles, and whatsoever other
offerings should be made. The whole city is in a bustle for the
preparation of the Festa; and the hearts of young men and women, who
take part therein, are set on naught but dancing, playing, singing,
banqueting, jousting, and other fair amusements as though naught else
were to be done in those weeks before the coming of S. John's Eve.&quot; The
minute account of the ceremonies observed on S. John's Day which
follows, need not be transcribed. Yet it may be well to call attention
to a <i>quattrocento</i> picture in the Florentine Academy, which illustrates
the customs of that festival. It is a long panel representing the
marriage of an Adimari with a daughter of the Ricasoli. The Baptistery
appears in the background; and on the piazza are ladies and young men,
clad in damask and rich stuffs, with jewels and fantastic head-dresses,
joining hands as though in act of dancing. Under the Loggia del Bigallo
sit the trumpeters of the Signory, blowing clarions adorned with
pennons. The lily of Florence is on these trappings. Serving men carry
vases and basins toward the Adimari palace, in preparation for the
wedding feast. A large portion of the square is covered in with a white
and red awning.</p>

<p>If the chroniclers and painters enable us to form some conception of
Florentine festivity, we are introduced to the persons and pastimes of
these jovial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">-54-</a></span> companies by the poet Folgore da San Gemignano.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Two
sets of his Sonnets have been preserved, the one upon the Months,
addressed to the leader of a noble Sienese company; the other on the
Days, to a member of a similar Florentine society. If we are right in
reckoning Folgore among the poets of the thirteenth century, the
facility and raciness of his style, its disengagement from
Proven&#231;alizing pedantry, and the irony of his luxurious hedonism, prove
to what extent the Tuscans had already left the middle age behind
them.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Folgore, in spite of his spring fragrance and auroral
freshness, anticipates the spirit of the Renaissance. He is a
thirteenth-century Boccaccio, without Boccaccio's enthusiasm for humane
studies. Ideal love, asceticism, religion, the virtues of the Christian
and the knight, are not for him. His soul is set on the enjoyment of the
hour. But this material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">-55-</a></span>ism is presented in a form of art so temperate,
with colors so refined and outlines so delicately drawn, that there is
nothing repulsive in it. His selfishness and sensuality are related to
Aretino's as the miniatures of a missal to Giulio Romano's Modes of
Venus.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>In his sonnets on the Months, Folgore addresses the Brigata as &quot;valiant
and courteous above Lancelot, ready, if need were, with lance in rest,
to spur along the lists of Camelot.&quot; In January he gives them good fires
and warm chambers, silken coverlids for their beds, and fur cloaks, and
sometimes in the day to sally forth and snow-ball girls upon the square:</p>

<p>In April the &quot;gentle country all abloom with fair fresh grass&quot; invites
the young men forth. Ladies shall go with them, to ride, display French
dresses, dance Proven&#231;al figures, or touch new instruments from Germany,
or roam through spacious parks. May brings in tournaments and showers of
blossoms&#8212;garlands and oranges flung from balcony and window&#8212;girls and

<p>In June the company of youths and maidens quit the city for the villa,
passing their time in shady gardens, where the fountains flow and
freshen the fine grass, and all the folk shall be love's servants. July
finds them in town again, avoiding the sun's heat and wearing silken
raiment in cool chambers where they feast. In August they are off to the
hills, riding at morn and eve from castle to castle, through upland
valleys where streams flow. September is the month of hawking; October
of fowling and midnight balls. With November and December winter comes
again, and brings the fireside pleasures of the town. On the whole,
there is too much said of eating and drinking in these sonnets; and the
series concludes with a piece of inhumane advice:</p>

<p>Such then was the joyous living, painted with colors of the fancy by a

century which placed the city under Guelf rule, in the plenitude of
peace, equality, and wealth by sea and land. Distinctions of class had
been obliterated. The whole population enjoyed equal rights and equal
laws. No man was idle; and though the simplicity of the past, praised by
Dante and Villani, was yielding to luxury, still the pleasure-seekers
were controlled by that fine taste which made the Florentines a race of
artists.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> This halcyon season was the boyhood of Dante and Giotto,
the prime of Arnolfo and Cimabue. The buildings whereby the City of the
Flower is still made beautiful above all cities of Italian soil, were
rising. The people abode in industry and order beneath the sway of their
elected leaders. Supreme in Tuscany, fearing no internal feuds, strong
in their militia of thirty thousand burghers to repel a rival State, the
Florentines had reached the climax of political prosperity. Not as yet
had arisen that little cloud, no bigger than a man's hand, above
Pistoja, which was destined to plunge them into the strife of Blacks and
Whites. During that interval of windless calm, in that fair city, where
the viol and the lute were never silent through spring-tide and summer,
the star of Italian poetry, that &quot;crowning glory of unblemished wealth,&quot;
went up and filled the heavens with light.</p>

</div>


<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">The</span> Sicilians followed closely in the track of the Proven&#231;al poets.
After, or contemporaneously with them, the same Italo-Proven&#231;al
literature was cultivated in the cities of central Italy. The
subject-matter of this imitative poetry was love&#8212;but love that bore a
peculiar relation to ordinary human feeling. Woman was regarded as an
ideal being, to be approached with worship bordering on adoration. The
lover derived personal force, virtue, elevation, energy, from his
enthusiastic passion. Honor, justice, courage, self-sacrifice, contempt
of worldly goods, flowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">-60-</a></span> from that one sentiment; and love united two
wills in a single ecstasy. Love was the consummation of spiritual
felicity, which surpassed all other modes of happiness in its beatitude.
Thus Bernard de Ventadour and Jacopo da Lentino were ready to forego
Paradise unless they might behold their lady's face before the throne of
God. For a certain period in modern history, this mysticism of the
amorous emotion was no affectation. It formulated a genuine impulse of
manly hearts, inflamed by beauty, and touched with the sense of moral
superiority in woman, perfected through weakness and demanding physical
protection. By bringing the cruder passions into accord with gentle
manners and unselfish aspirations, it served to temper the rudeness of
primitive society; and no little of its attraction was due to the
conviction that only refined natures could experience it. This new
aspect of love was due to chivalry, to Christianity, to the Teutonic
reverence for women, in which religious awe seems to have blended with
the service of the weaker by the stronger.</p>

<p>Sincere and beautiful as the ideal of chivalrous love may have been, it
speedily degenerated. Chivalry, though a vital element of feudalism,
existed, even among the nations of its origin, more as an aspiration
than a reality. In Italy it never penetrated the life or subdued the
imagination of the people. For the Italo-Proven&#231;al poets that code of
love was almost wholly formal. They found it ready made. They used it
because the culture of a Court, in sympathy with feudal Europe, left
them no other choice. Not Arthur, but the Virgilian &#198;neas, was still the
Italian hero;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">-61-</a></span> and instead of S. Louis, the nations of the South could
only boast of a crusading Frederick II. Frederick the troubadour was a
no less anomalous being than Frederick the crusader. He conformed to
contemporary fashion, but his spirit ran counter to the age. Curiosity,
incipient humanism, audacious doubt, the toleration which inclined him
to fraternize with Saracens and seek the learning of the Arabs, placed
him outside the sphere of thirteenth century conceptions. His expedition
to the East appears a mere parade excursion, hypocritical, political,
ironical. In like manner his love-poetry and that of his courtiers rings
hollow in our ears.</p>

<p>It harmonized with the Italian genius, when Guido Guinicelli treated
chivalrous love from the standpoint of Bolognese learning. He altered
none of the forms; he used the conventional phraseology. But he infused
a new spirit into the subject-matter. His poetry ceased to be formal;
the phrases were no longer verbiage. The epicureanism of Frederick's
life clashed with the mystic exaltation of knighthood. There was no
discord between Guido's scientific habit of mind and his expression of a
philosophical idea conveyed in terms of amorous enthusiasm. Upon his
lips the words:</p>

<p>acquire reality&#8212;not the reality of passion, but of sincere thought.
They do not convey the spontaneity of feeling, but a philosopher's
contemplation of love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">-62-</a></span> and beauty in their influence on human character.
Guido's mood might be compared with that of the Greek sage, when he
exclaimed that neither the morning nor the evening star is so wonderful
as Justice, or when he thus apostrophized Virtue:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">

<p>For the chivalrous races, Love had been an enthusiastic ideal. For the
Italo-Proven&#231;al euphuists it supplied an artificial inspiration. At
Bologna it became the form of transcendental science; and here the
Italian intellect touched, by accident or instinct, the same note that
had been struck by Plato in the &quot;Ph&#230;drus&quot; and &quot;Symposium.&quot;</p>

<p>A public trained in legal and scholastic studies, whose mental furniture
was drawn from S. Thomas and Accursius, hailed their poet in Guido
Guinicelli. For them it was natural that poetry should veil philosophy
with verse; that love should be confounded with the movement of the soul
toward truth; that beauty should be treated as the manifestation of a
spiritual good. Dante in his Canzone, <i>Donne ch'avete intelletto
d'amore</i>, appeals, not to emotion, but to intelligence. He tells us that
<i>understanding</i> was the ancient name of <i>love</i>, and describes the effect
of passion in a young man's heart as a revelation raising him above the
level of common experience. Thus the transmutation of the simpler
elements of the chivalrous code into philosophical doctrine, where the
form of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">-63-</a></span> worshiped lady transcends the sphere of sense, and her
spirit is identified with the lover's deepest thought and loftiest
aspiration, was sincere in medieval Florence. The Tuscan intellect was
too virile and sternly strung to be satisfied with amorous rhymes. The
contemporary theory of &#230;sthetics demanded allegory, and imposed upon the
poet erudition; nor was it easy for the singer of that epoch to command
his own immediate emotions, or to use them for the purposes of a direct
and plastic art. Enjoying neither the freedom of the Greek nor the
disengagement of the modern spirit, he found it more proper to clothe a
scientific content with the veil of passion, than to paint the
personality of the woman he loved with natural precision. Between the
mysticism of a sublime but visionary adoration on the one side, and the
sensualities of vulgar appetite or the decencies of married life on the
other, there lay for him no intermediate artistic region. He understood
the love of the imagination and the love of the senses; but the love of
the heart, familiar to the Northern races, hardly existed for him.</p>

<p>And here it may be parenthetically noticed that the Italians, in the
middle ages, created no feminine ideal analogous to Gudrun or
Chriemhild, Iseult or Guinevere. When they left the high region of
symbolism, they descended almost without modulation to the prose of
common life. Thus the Selvaggia of Cino, the Beatrice of Dante, the
Laura of Petrarch, made way for the Fiammetta of Boccaccio and the women
of the Decameron, when that ecstasy of earlier enthusiasm exhausted. For
a while, however, the Florentines were well prepared to give an
intellectual significance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">-64-</a></span> and with it a new life, to the outworn
conventions of the Italo-Proven&#231;al lyrists. Nor must it be thought that
the emotions thus philosophized were unreal. Dante loved Beatrice,
though she became for him an allegory. The splendid vision of her beauty
and goodness attended him through life, assuming the guidance of his
soul in all its stages. Difficult as it may be to comprehend this
blending of the real and transcendental, we must grasp it if we desire
to penetrate the spirit of the fourteenth century in Italy.</p>

<p>The human heart remains unchanged. No metaphysical sophistication, no
allegory, no scholastic mysticism, can destroy the spontaneity of
instinct in a man who loves, or cloud a poet's vision. Love does not
cease to be love because it is sublimed to the quintessence of a
self-denying passion. It still retains its life in feeling, and its root
in sense. Beauty does not cease to be beautiful because it has been
moralized and identified with the attraction that lifts men upward to
the sphere of the eternal truths. Nor is poetry extinguished because the
singer deems it his vocation to utter genuine thought, and scorns the
rhyming pastimes of the simple amorist. The Florentine school presents
us with a poetry which aimed at being philosophical, but which at the
same time vibrated with life and delineated moods of delicate emotion.
To effect a flawless fusion between these two strains in the new style,
was infinitely difficult; nor were the poets of that epoch equally
successful. Guido Cavalcanti, the leader of the group which culminates
in Dante, won his fame by verse that savors more of the dialectician
than the singer. Ranking science above poetry, he is said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">-65-</a></span> have
disdained even Virgil. His odes are dryly scholastic&#8212;especially that
famous <i>Donna mi priega</i>, which contemporaries studied clause by clause,
and which, after two centuries, served Dino del Garbo for the text of a
metaphysical discourse.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> At the same time, certain lyrics, composed
in a lighter mood by the same poet, have in them the essence of
spontaneous and natural inspiration. His Ballate were probably regarded
by himself and his friends as playthings, thrown off in idle moments to
distract a mind engaged in thorny speculations. Yet we find here the
first full blossom of genuine Italian verse. Their beauty is that of
popular song, starting flowerlike from the soil, and fragrant in its
first expansion beneath the sun of courtesy and culture. Nothing
remained, in this kind, for Boccaccio and Poliziano, but to echo the
Ballata of the country maidens, and to complete the welcome to the
May.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Two currents of verse, the one rising from the senses, the other from
the brain, the one deriving force and fullness from the people, the
other nourished by the schools, flowed apart in Guido Cavalcanti's
poetry. They were combined into a single stream by Cino da Pistoja.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Cino was a jurist of encyclop&#230;dic erudition, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">-66-</a></span>as well as a sweet and
fluent singer.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> His verses have the polish and something of the chill
of marble. His Selvaggia deserves a place with Beatrice and Laura. From
Cino Petrarch derived his mastery of limpid diction. In Cino the
artistic sense of the Italians awoke. He produced something distinct
both from the scientific style of Guido Guinicelli, and also from the
wilding song which Guido Cavalcanti's Ballate echoed. He seems to have
applied himself to the main object of polishing poetical diction, and
rendering expression at once musical and lucid.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Though his hold upon
ideas was not so firm as Cavalcanti's, nor his passion so intense, he
achieved a fusion of thought and feeling in an artistic whole of
sympathetic suavity. We instinctively compare his work with that of Mino
da Fiesole in bass-relief.</p>

<p>Dante was five years older than Cino. To him belongs the glory of having
effected the same fusion in a lyric poetry at once more comprehensive
and more lofty. Dante yields no point as a dialectician and subtle
thinker to Guido Cavalcanti. He surpasses Cino da Pistoja as an artist.
His passion and imagination are more fiery than Guido's. His tenderness
is deeper and more touching than Cino's. Even <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">-67-</a></span>in those minor works with
which he preluded the Divine Comedy, Dante soars above all competition,
taking rank among the few poets born to represent an age and be the
everlasting teachers of the human soul. Yet even Dante, though knowing
that he was destined to eclipse both the Guidi, though claiming Love
alone for his inspirer, was not wholly free from the scholasticism of
his century. In the earlier lyrics of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> and in the
Canzoni of the <i>Convito</i>, he allows his feeling to be over-weighted by
the scientific content. Between his emotion and our sympathy there
rises, now and again, the mist of metaphysic. While giving them intenser
meaning, he still plays upon the commonplaces of his predecessors. Thus
in the sonnet <i>Amor e 'l cor gentil son una cosa</i> he rehandles
Guinicelli's theme; while the following stanza repeats the well-worn
doctrine that Love should be the union of beauty and of excellence<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>:</p>

<p>Dante's concessions to the mannerism of the school weigh as nothing in
the scales against the beauty and the truth of that most spiritual of
romances, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">-68-</a></span> which the <i>Vita Nuova</i> gives melodic utterance. Within the
compass of one little book is bound up all that Florence in the
thirteenth century contributed to the refinement of medieval manners,
together with all that the new school of poets had imagined of highest
in their philosophical conception. The harmony of life and science
attains completion in the real but idealized experience, which
transcends and combines both motives in a personality uniquely
constituted for this blending. It is enough for the young Dante to meet
Beatrice, to pass her among her maidens in the city-ways, to receive her
salute, to admire her moving through the many-colored crowd, to meditate
upon her apparition, as of one of God's angels, in the solitude of his
chamber. She is a dream, a vision. But it is the dream of his existence,
the vision that unfolds for him the universe&#8212;more actual, more steeped
in emotion, more stimulative of sublime aspiration and virile purpose
than many loves which find fruition in long years of intercourse. We
feel that the man's true self has been revealed to him; that he has
given his life-blood to the ideal which, without this nourishment, would
have ranked among phantoms, but is now reality. Students who have not
followed the stages through which the doctrine of chivalrous love
reached Dante, and the process whereby it was transmuted into science
for the guidance of the soul, will regard the records of the <i>Vita
Nuova</i> as shadowy or sentimental. Or if they only dwell upon the
philosophical aspect of Dante's work, if they do not make allowance for
the natural stirring of a heart that throbbed with liveliest feeling,
they will fail to com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">-69-</a></span>prehend this book, at once so complex and so
simple. The point lies exactly in the fusion of two elements&#8212;in the
truth of the passion, the truth of the idealization, and the spontaneity
of the artistic form combining them. What is most intelligible, because
most common to all phases of profound emotion, in the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, is
its grief&#8212;the poet's sympathy with Beatrice in the house of mourning
for her father's death, the vision of her own passage from earth to
heaven, and the apostrophe to the pilgrims who thread the city clothed
with mourning for her loss.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> No one, reading these poems, will doubt
that, though Beatrice did but cross the path of Dante's life and shed
her brightness on it for a season from afar, the thought of her had
penetrated heart and fiber, making him a man new-born through love, and
striking in his soul a note that should resound through all his years,
through all the centuries which grow to understand him.</p>

<p>Dante was born in 1265 of poor but noble parents, who reconciled
themselves to the Guelf party. He first saw Beatrice in his ninth year;
and, when a man, he well remembered how her beauty dawned upon him.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
&quot;Her dress, on that day, was of a most noble color, a subdued and goodly
crimson, girdled and adorned in such sort as best suited with her very
tender age. At that moment, I say most truly that the spirit of life,
which hath its dwelling in the secretest chamber of the heart, began to
tremble so violently that the least pulses of my body shook therewith;
and in trembling it said these words: <i>Ecce deus fortior me <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">-70-</a></span>qui veniens
dominabitur mihi</i>.&quot; Beatrice died in 1290, and Dante closed the <i>Vita
Nuova</i> with these words<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>: &quot;It was given unto me to behold a very
wonderful vision; wherein I saw things which determined me that I would
say nothing further of this most blessed one, until such time as I could
discourse more worthily concerning her. And to this end I labor all I
can; as she well knoweth. Wherefore if it be His pleasure through whom
is the life of all things, that my life continue with me a few years, it
is my hope that I shall yet write concerning her what hath not before
been written of any woman. After the which, may it seem good unto Him
who is the Master of Grace, that my spirit should go hence to behold the
glory of its lady: to wit, of that blessed Beatrice who now gazeth
continually on His countenance <i>qui est per omnia s&#230;cula, benedictus.
Laus Deo</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>This passage was written possibly in Dante's twenty-eighth year. The
consecration of his younger manhood was the love of Beatrice. She made
him a poet. Through her came to him the &quot;sweet new style,&quot; which shone
with purest luster in his verse; and the songs he made of Beatrice were
known through all the City of the Flower. Yet love had not absorbed his
energies. He studied under Brunetto Latini, and qualified himself for
the career of a Florentine citizen by entering the Guild of Speziali.
After Beatrice's death a great and numbing sorrow fell upon him. From
this eclipse he recovered by the help of reading, and also by the
distractions of public life. He fought in the battle of Campaldino, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">-71-</a></span>married his wife Gemma Donati. He went as ambassador to San Gemignano
in 1299; and in the year 1300, when Florence was divided by the parties
of Cerchi and Donati, he fulfilled the functions of the Priorate. These
ten years between Beatrice's death and Dante's election as Prior were a
period of hesitation and transition. He was no longer the poet of Divine
Love, inspired by spontaneous emotion, mastering and glorifying the form
which tradition imposed on verse. He had become a student of philosophy;
and this change makes itself felt in the more abstruse and abstract odes
of the <i>Convito</i>. Yet he was still attended, through those years of
study, civic engagements and domestic duties, by the vision of Beatrice.
This is how he speaks of science in the second part of the <i>Convito</i>:
&quot;After some time my mind, which strove to regain strength, bethought
itself (since neither my own consolations nor those of friends availed
me aught) of having recourse to the method which had helped to comfort
other spirits in distress. I took to reading the book, not known to many
students, of Boethius, wherewith, unhappy and in exile, he had comforted
himself. And hearing also that Tully had written another book in which,
while treating of friendship, he had used words of consolation to L&#230;lius
in the death of his friend Scipio, I read that also, and as it happens
that a man goes seeking silver, and far from his design finds gold,
which hidden causes yield him, not perchance without God's guidance, so
I who sought for consolation found not only comfort for my tears, but
also words of authors and of sciences and of books, weighing the which,
I judged well that philo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">-72-</a></span>sophy, the lady of these authors, of these
sciences and of these books, was a thing supreme. And I imagined her in
fashion like a gentle lady, nor could I fancy her otherwise than
piteous; wherefore so truly did I gaze upon her with adoring eyes that
scarcely could I turn myself away. And having thus imagined her I began
to go where she displayed her very self, that is, in the schools of the
religious, and the disputations of philosophers; so that in short time,
about thirty months, I began so much to feel her sweetness that her love
chased away and destroyed all other thought in me.&quot;</p>

<p>Beatrice, who in her lifetime had been the revelation of beauty and all
good, lifting her lover above the region of sordid thoughts, and opening
a sphere of spiritual intelligence, now accompanied him through the
labyrinths of speculation. She was still the form, the essence, of all
he learned; and the vow which closes the <i>Vita Nuova</i> had not been
forgotten.</p>

<p>Through the transition period, marked by the <i>Convito</i>, we are led to
the third stage of Dante's life&#8212;those twenty-one years, during which he
roamed in exile over Italy, and wrote the poem of medieval Christianity.
The studies of which the <i>Convito</i> forms a fragment, and the political
career which ended in the embassy to Boniface, were both necessary for
the <i>Divine Comedy</i>. Had it not been for Dante's exile, the modern world
might have lacked its first and greatest epic; Beatrice might have
missed her promised apotheosis. As her hand had guided him through the
paths of love and the labyrinths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">-73-</a></span> science, so now the brightness of
her glorified face lifted him from sphere to sphere of Paradise. By
gazing on her eyes, he rose through heaven, and stood with her before
the splendor of the Beatific Vision. To identify Beatrice with Theology
in this last stage of Dante's spiritual life is a facile but inadequate
expedient of criticism. From the earliest she had been for him the light
and guidance of his soul; and at the last he ascribed to her the best
and the sublimest of his inspirations.</p>

<p>Since its origin Italian poetry had pursued one line of evolution, first
following and then transmuting the traditions of Provence. In the
<i>Divine Comedy</i> it took a new direction. Chivalry, insufficient for the
nation and ill-adapted to its temper, yielded to a motive force derived
from the religious sentiment. The Bible history, the Lives of the
Saints, and the doctrine of the Church concerning the future of mankind,
together with the emotions of piety, had hitherto received but partial
exposition at the hands of a few poets of the people. S. Francis struck
the keynote of popular Italian poetry in his <i>Cantico del Sole</i>, which
can be accepted as the first specimen of composition in the vulgar
tongue. Guittone of Arezzo, already mentioned as the earliest learned
poet who attempted to nationalize his style, acquired fame as the writer
of one sublime sonnet to Madonna and two Canzoni to the Mother and her
Son.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> But the most decisive impulse toward religious poetry was given
by the Flagel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">-74-</a></span>lants, who, starting from the Umbrian highlands in 1290,
diffused their peculiar devotion over Italy. I shall have occasion to
return in a future chapter to the history of this movement and to trace
its influence over popular Italian literature. It is enough, at present,
to have mentioned it among the forces tending toward religious poetry
upon the close of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The spirit of the epoch inclined to Allegory and Vision. When we
remember the prestige of Virgil in the middle ages, both as a
philosopher and also as the precursor of Christianity, it will be
understood how his descent into Hades fascinated the imagination, and
prepared the mind to accept the Vision as a proper form for conveying
theological doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The Journey of S. Brandan, the Purgatory of S.
Patrick, and the Visions of Tundalus and Alberic pretended to
communicate information concerning the soul's state after death, the
places of punishment, and the method of salvation. In course of time the
Vision was used for political or ecclesiastical purposes by preachers
who averred that they had seen the souls of eminent sinners in torment.
It became an engine of terrorism, assumed satiric tone, and finally fell
into the hands of didactic or merely fanciful poets.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The chief preoccupation of the medieval mind was with the future destiny
of man. This life came to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">-75-</a></span>regarded as a preparation for eternity.
Like a foreground, the actual world served to relieve the picture of the
world beyond the grave. Therefore popular literature abounded in manuals
of devotion and discipline, some of which set forth the history of the
soul in allegorical form. Among other examples may be cited three
stories of the spiritual life, corresponding to its three stages of
Nature, Purification, and Restoration, conveyed under the titles of
<i>Umano</i>, <i>Spoglia</i>, <i>Rinuova</i>. Many prelusions of this class were
combined in one religious drama called <i>Commedia dell'Anima</i>, the
substance of which is certainly old, though the form yields evidence of
sixteenth-century <i>rifacimento</i>.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The object of the foregoing paragraphs has been to show that the popular
intellect was well prepared for religious poetry, and had appropriated
the forms of Allegory and Vision. Not in order to depreciate the
originality of Dante, but to prove in how vital a relation he stood
toward his age, I have here insisted on those formless preludes to his
work of art. In the Epistle to Can Grande he thus explains the theme of
the <i>Commedia</i>: &quot;The subject of the whole work, taken literally, is the
state of souls after death, regarded as fact; for the action deals with
this, and is about this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">-76-</a></span> But if the work be taken allegorically, its
subject is man, in so far as by merit or demerit in the exercise of free
will he is exposed to the rewards or punishments of justice.&quot; Attending
to the letter, we find in the <i>Commedia</i> a vision of that life beyond
the tomb, in relation to which alone our life on earth has value. It
presents a picture of the everlasting destiny of souls, so firmly
apprehended and vividly imagined by the medieval fancy. But since this
picture has to set forth mysteries seen and heard by none, the
revelation itself, like S. John's Apocalypse, is conveyed in symbols
fashioned to adumbrate the truths perceived by faith. The same symbols
portray another reality, not apprehended merely by faith, but brought
home to the heart by experience. Attending to the allegory, we find in
the <i>Commedia</i> a history of the soul in this life&#8212;an ethical analysis
of sin, purgation and salvation through grace. The poem is a narrative
of Dante's journey through the region into which all pass after death;
but at the same time it describes the hell and heaven and the transition
through repentance from sin to grace, which are the actual conditions of
the soul in this life. The <i>Inferno</i> depicts unmitigated evil. The
<i>Paradiso</i> exhibits goodness, absolute and free from stain. In the one
there is no relief, in the other no alloy; the one is darkness, the
other light. The intermediate region of the <i>Purgatorio</i> is a realm of
expectation and conversion, where sin is no longer possible, but where
the fruition of goodness is delayed by the necessity of purification.
Here then are the natural alternations of day and night, the relative
twilight of a world where all is yet transition rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">-77-</a></span> than
fulfillment. It may be observed that Purgatory belongs to the order of
things which by their nature pass away; while Hell and Heaven are both
eternal. Therefore the <i>Commedia</i>, considered as an apocalypse of the
undying soul, reveals absolute damnation and absolute salvation, both
states being destined to endure so long as God's justice and love exist;
but it also reveals a state of purifying pain, which ceases when the men
who need it have been numbered. Considered as an allegory of the
spiritual life on earth, it describes the process of escape from eternal
condemnation through grace into eternal happiness.</p>

<p>A theme so vast and all-embracing enabled Dante to inform the whole
knowledge of his epoch. The <i>Commedia</i> is the poem of that scholastic
theology which absorbed every branch of science and brought the world
within the scope of one thought, God. As the <i>Summa</i> of S. Thomas
combined philosophy and revelation, so Dante included both the Pagan and
Christian dispensations in his scheme. He starts from the wood of
terror, where men are assailed by the wild beasts of their passions; and
two guides lead him, by the light of knowledge, up to God. The one is
Virgil, the other Beatrice&#8212;Virgil, who stands for human reason,
science, the four cardinal virtues; Beatrice, who symbolizes divine
grace, faith formulated in theology, the virtues bestowed on man through
Christ for his salvation. Virgil cannot lead the poet beyond Purgatory;
because thus far only is human knowledge of avail to elevate and guide
the soul. Beatrice lifts him through the spheres of Paradise by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">-78-</a></span>
contemplation; because the highest summit attained by reason and natural
virtue is but the starting point of the true Christian's journey.</p>

<p>The <i>Commedia</i> is thus the drama or the epos of the soul. It condenses
all that man has thought or done, can think or do; all that he knows
about the universe around him, all that he hopes or fears from the
future; his intuition of an incorruptible and ideal order, underlying
and controlling the phenomenal world. God, the world and man are brought
into one focus; and the interest of the poem is the relation of the
individual soul to them, the participation of each human personality in
the dramatic action. It need hardly be observed that Dante's solutions
of the problems which arise in the development of this theme, are
medieval. His physical science has been superseded. His theology is far
from approving itself to the general consciousness of Christians in our
age. Yet while all must recognize this obvious truth, the essence of the
<i>Commedia</i> is indestructible because of its humanity, because of the
personality which animates it. Men change far less than the hypotheses
of religion and philosophy, which take form from experience as shadows
fly before the sun. However these may alter, man remains substantially
the same; and Dante penetrated human nature as few have done&#8212;was such a
man as few have been. The unity and permanence of his poem are in
himself. Never was a plan so vast and various permeated so completely
with a single self. At once creator and spectator of his vision,
neophyte and hierophant, arraigned and judge, he has not only seen hell
as the local prison-house of pain, but has felt it as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">-79-</a></span> state of sin
within his heart. He has passed through purifying fires; and the songs
of Paradise have sounded by anticipation in his ears. Dante is both the
singer and the hero of his epic. In him the universal idea of mankind
becomes concrete. The continuous experience of this living person who is
at one and the same time a figure of each and every soul that ever
breathed, and also the real Dante Alighieri, exile from Florence without
blame, sustains as on one thread the medley of successive motives which
else might lack poetic unity, gives life to a scheme which else might be
too abstract. Expanding to embrace the universe, contracting to a point
within one breast, the <i>Commedia</i> combines the general and the
particular in an individual commensurate with man.</p>

<p>It may be conjectured that Dante, obeying the scholastic impulse of his
age, started from the abstract or universal. Therein lay the reality of
things, not in the particular. What has been already quoted from the
letter to Can Grande justifies this supposition. He meant to lay bare
the scheme of the universe, as understood by medieval Christianity, and
viewed from the standpoint of the human agent. That scheme presented
itself in a series of propositions, a logic or a metaphysic apprehended
as truth. Each portion of the poem was mapped out with rigorous
accuracy. Each section illustrated a thought, an argument, a position.
The whole might be surveyed as a structure of connected syllogisms. To
this scientific articulation of its leading motives corresponds the
architectural symmetry, the simple outlines and severe masses of the
<i>Commedia</i>. The plan, however minute in detail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">-80-</a></span> is comprehended at a
glance. The harmonies of the design are as geometrical as some colossal
church imagined by Bramante. But Dante had no intention of re-writing
the <i>Summa</i> in verse. He meant to be a poet, using the vulgar speech of
&quot;that low Italy&quot; in the production of an epic which should rank on equal
terms with the <i>&#198;neid</i>, and be for modern Christendom what that had been
for sacred Rome. Furthermore he had it in his heart to yield such honor
to Virgil, &quot;leader, lord, and master,&quot; as none had ever paid, and to
write concerning Beatrice &quot;what had not before been written of any
woman.&quot; His poem was to be the storehouse of his personal experience.
His love and hatred, his admiration of greatness and his scorn for
cowardice, his resentment of injury, his gratitude for service rendered,
his political creed and critical opinions, the joy he had of nature, and
the pain he suffered when he walked with men: all this was to find
expression at right seasons and in seemly order. Upon the severe
framework of abstract truth, which forms the skeleton of the <i>Commedia</i>
and is the final end of its existence, Dante felt free to superimpose
materials of inexhaustible variety. Following the metaphor of building
more exactly, we may say that he employed these materials as the stones
whereby he brought his architectural design to view. The abstract
thought of the <i>Commedia</i>, tyrannous and all-controlling as it is, could
not lay claim to reality but for the dramatic episodes which present it
to the intellect through the imagination.</p>

<p>Some such clothing of abstractions with concrete images was intended in
the medieval theory of allegory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">-81-</a></span> The Church proscribed the poets of
antiquity; and it had become an axiom that poetry was the art of
lies.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Poetry was hardly suffered to exist except as a veil to cloak
some hidden doctrine; and allegory presented a middle way of escape,
whereby the pleasure of art could be enjoyed with a safe conscience.
Virgil, whom the middle ages would not have relinquished, though a
General Council had condemned him, received the absolution of
allegorical interpretation. Dante, who defined poetry as the art &quot;which
publishes the truth concealed beneath a veil of fable,&quot; frequently
interrupts the story to bid his readers note the meaning underneath the
figures of his verse. In composing the <i>Commedia</i>, he had moral
edification and scientific truth for his end. The dramatic, narrative,
descriptive, and lyrical beauties of his poem served to bring into
relief or to shroud in appropriate mystery&#8212;since allegory both
elucidates and obscures the matter it conveys&#8212;the doctrines he designed
to inculcate. Still Dante stood, as a poet, at a height so far above his
age and his own theories, that the cold and numbing touch of symbolism
rarely mars the interest of his work. We may, perhaps, feel a certain
confusion between the personalities of Virgil and Beatrice and the
thoughts they represent, which chills our sympathy, raising a feeling of
indignation when Virgil returns unwept to Hell, and removing Beatrice
into a world of intangible ideas. We may find the pageant at the close
of the &quot;Purgatory&quot; unattractive; nor will the sublimity of the
&quot;Paradiso&quot; save the figures by which spiritual meanings are here
suggested, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">-82-</a></span> occasional grotesqueness. Thus much can be conceded.
Dante, though born to be the poet of all time, was still a scion of his
epoch. He could not altogether escape the influences of a misleading
conception. But, apart from allegory, apart from didactic purpose, the
<i>Commedia</i> takes highest rank for the episodes, the action, the personal
interest which never flags. No poet ever had a finer sense of reality,
and none commanded the means of expressing it in all its forms more
fully. Dante's own theory of symbolism offered an illimitable sphere for
the exercise of his imagination, since it led him to give visible and
palpable shape to the thoughts of his brain. And here it may be noted
that the allegorical heresy proved less pernicious than another form of
false opinion based upon an ideal of classical purity might have been.
Since the poem was to present truth under a cloak of metaphor, it did
not signify what figures were used. The purpose they served, justified
them. Therefore Dante found himself at liberty to mingle satire with the
hymns of angels; to seek illustrations from vulgar life no less than
from nature in her sublimest moods; to delineate the horrible, the
painful, the grotesque, and the improbable with the same sincerity as
the beautiful, the charming, and the familiar. His dramatic faculty was
exercised on themes so varied that to classify them is impossible&#8212;on
the pathos of Francesca and the terror of Ugolino; the skirmish of the
fiends in Malebolge and the meeting of Statius with Virgil; the pride of
Farinata and the penitence of Manfred; the agonies of Adamo da Brescia
and the calm delights of Piccarda dei Donati. He tells the stories of
Ulysses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">-83-</a></span> and S. Francis, describes the flight of the Roman eagle and
Cacciaguida's manhood, with equal energy of brief but ineffaceably
impressive narration. This license inherent in the use of allegory
justified his classing the fameless folk of his own days with the heroes
of Biblical and classical antiquity, and permitted him to mingle ancient
history with his censure of contemporary politics. All times, ages,
countries, races of men are alike before the tribunal of God's justice.
Accordingly, the poet who had taken man's moral nature for his theme,
and was bound by his theory to present this theme symbolically, could
bring to view a multitude of concrete persons, arranged (whatever else
may issue from their converse with the protagonist) according to
gradations of merit or demerit. Thus the <i>Divine Comedy</i>, though written
with a didactic object and under the influence of allegory, surpasses
every other epic in the distinctness of its motives and the realism of
their presentation. The brief and pregnant style which scorns rhetorical
adornment, the accurate picture-painting which aims at vivid delineation
of the thing to be discerned, harmonize with its inflexible ethics, its
uncompromising sincerity, its intense human feeling.</p>

<p>The <i>Commedia</i> is too widely commensurate with its theme, the Human
Soul, to be described or classified. The men of its era called it the
<i>Divine</i>; and this title it has preserved, in spite of the fierce
censures of the Church which it contains. They called it <i>La Divina</i>
because of its material doubtless, but also, we may dare to think,
because of its unfathomable depth and height and breadth of thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">-84-</a></span> In
course of time chairs were established at Florence, Padua, and in other
cities, for its explanation; and the labor of the commentator was
applied to it. That labor has been continued from Boccaccio's down to
our own day; yet the dark places of the <i>Commedia</i> have not been
illuminated, nor is learning likely to solve some problems which perplex
a careful student of its cantos. That matters, indeed, but little; for
the main scope and purpose of the poem are plain, and its spirit is such
that none who read can fail to recognize it.</p>

<p>Before Dante the Christian world had no poet, and Italy had no voice.
The gift of Dante to Europe was an Epic on the one subject which united
the modern nations in community of interest. The gift of Dante to his
country was a masterpiece which placed her on a par with Homer's Hellas
and with Virgil's Rome. If the first century of Italian literature could
have produced three men of the caliber of Dante, Italy would have run
her future course, as she began, abreast with ancient Greece. That was
not, however, destined to be. The very conditions of the mission she had
to fulfill in the fourteenth and two following centuries, rendered the
emergence of a race of heroes impossible. Italy was about to recover the
past. Her energies could not be concentrated on the evolution of herself
in a new literature. To Dante succeeded Petrarch and Boccaccio.</p>

<p>Petrarch was born at Arezzo in the year 1304, when his father, like
Dante, and in the same cause, had been expelled from Florence. His
youth, passed partly in Tuscany and partly at Avignon, coincided with
the years spent by Dante in the composition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">-85-</a></span> the <i>Commedia</i>. He was a
student at Montpellier, neglecting his law-books for Cicero and Virgil,
when Dante died at Ravenna in 1321. During those seventeen years of
Dante's exile and Petrarch's boyhood, a change had passed over the
political scene. The Papacy was transferred from Rome to France. The
last attempts of the German Emperors to vindicate their authority below
the Alps had failed. The Communes were yielding to anarchy and party
feuds, or fast becoming the prey of despots. A new age had begun; and of
this new age Petrarch was the representative, as Dante had been the poet
of the ages which had passed away. Petrarch's inauguration of the
classical Revival has been already described in this work; nor is it
necessary to repeat the services he rendered to the cause of
humanism.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> In a volume dealing with Italian literature the poet of
the <i>Canzoniere</i> must engage attention rather than the resuscitator of
antique learning. It is Petrarch's peculiar glory to have held two
equally illustrious places in the history of modern civilization, as the
final lyrist of chivalrous love and as the founder of the Renaissance.
Yet this double attitude, when we compare him with Dante, constitutes
the chief cause of his manifest inferiority.</p>

<p>The differences between Dante's and Petrarch's education were marked,
and tended to accentuate the divergence of their intellectual and moral
qualities. Dante, who lived until maturity within sight of his <i>bel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">-86-</a></span> San
Giovanni</i>, grew up a Florentine in core and fiber. In his earliest work,
the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, there is a home-bred purity of style, as of something
which could only have been perfected in Florence; a beauty akin to that
of Giotto's tower; a perfume as of some flower peculiar to a district
whence it will not bear transplanting. In his latest, the <i>Paradiso</i>, he
devotes one golden canto to the past prosperity of Florence, another to
her decadence through the corruption of her citizens. While wandering
like &quot;the world's rejected guest&quot; away from that fair city of his birth,
the unrest of his pilgrimage, contrasted with the peace of earlier
manhood, only strengthened the Florentine within him. Though he
traversed Italy in length and breadth, though the <i>Commedia</i> furnishes
an epitome of her landscapes and her local customs, describes her cities
and resumes her history, the thought of national unity was not present
to his mind. Italy remained for him the garden of the empire, the unruly
colt whom C&#230;sar should bestride and curb. Elsewhere than in Florence
Dante felt himself an alien. He refused the poet's crown unless it could
be taken by the font of baptism upon the square of Florence. He chose
banishment with honor and the stars of heaven, rather than ignominious
entrance through the gates he loved so well; and yet from the highest
sphere of Paradise he turned his eyes down to Florence and her erring
folk:</p>

<p>Petrarch, called to perform another mission, had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">-87-</a></span> different training.
Brought up from earliest infancy in exile, transferred from Tuscany to
France, deprived of civic rights and disengaged from the duties of a
burgher in those troublous times, he surveyed the world from his study
and judged its affairs with the impartiality of a philosopher. Without a
city, without a home, without a family, consecrated to the priesthood
and absorbed in literary interests, he spent his life in musings at
Vaucluse or in the splendid hospitalities of the Lombard Courts. Through
all his wanderings he was a visitor, the citizen of no republic, but the
freeman of the City of the Spirit. Without exaggeration he might have
chosen for his motto the phrase of Marcus Aurelius: &quot;I will not say dear
city of Cecrops but dear city of God!&quot; Avignon, where his intellect was
formed in youth, had become through the residence of the Popes the
capital of Christendom, the only center of political and ecclesiastical
activity where an ideal of universal culture could arise. Itself in
exile, the Papacy still united the modern nations by a common bond; but
its banishment from Rome was the sign of a new epoch, when the hegemony
of civilization should be transferred from the Church to secular
control. In this way Petrarch was enabled to shape a conception of
humanism which left the middle age behind; and when his mind dwelt on
Italy at a distance, he could think of her as the great Italic land,
inheritor of Rome, mother of a people destined to be one, born to rule,
or if not rule, at least to regenerate the world through wisdom. From
his lips we hear of Florence nothing; but for the first time the
passionate cry of <i>Italia mia</i> the appeal of an Italian who recognized
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">-88-</a></span> race, yet had no local habitation on the sacred soil, vibrates in
his oratorical <i>canzoni</i>. Petrarch's dreams of a united Italy and a
resuscitated Roman republic were hardly less visionary than Dante's
ideal of universal monarchy with Rome for the seat of empire. Yet in his
lyrics the true conception of Italy, one intellectually in spite of
political discord and foreign oppression, the real and indestructible
unity of the nation in a spirit destined to control the future of the
human race, came suddenly to consciousness. There was an out-cry in
their passion-laden strophes which gathered volume as the years rolled
over Italy, until at last, in her final prostration beneath Spanish
Austria, they seemed less poems than authentic prophecies.</p>

<p>Thus while Dante remained a Florentine, Petrarch was the first Italian.
Nor is it insignificant that whereas Dante refused the poet's crown
unless he could place the laurels on his head in Florence, Petrarch
ascended the Capitol among the plaudits of the Romans, and, in the
absence of Pope and Emperor, received his wreath from the Senator
Romanus. Dante's renunciation and Petrarch's acceptance of this honor
were equally appropriate. Dante, as was fitting for a man of his era,
looked still to the Commune. Petrarch's coronation on the Capitol was
the outward sign that the age of the Communes was over, that culture was
destined to be cosmopolitan, and that the Eternal City, symbolizing the
imperishable empire of the intellect, was now the proper throne of men
marked out to sway the world by thoughts and written words.</p>

<p>In Petrarch the particular is superseded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">-89-</a></span> universal. The citizen
is sunk in the man. The political prejudices of the partisan are
conspicuous by absence. His language has lost all trace of dialect. He
writes Italian, special to no district, though Tuscan in its source; and
his verse fixes the standard of poetic diction for all time in Italy.
These changes mark an important stage in literature emerging from its
origins, and account for Petrarch's unequaled authority during the next
three centuries. Dante's Epic is classical because of its vivid humanity
and indestructible material; but its spirit is medieval and its details
are strictly localized. Petrarch's outlook over the world and life is,
in form at least, less confined to the limitations of his age.
Consequently the students of a period passing rapidly beyond the
medieval cycle of ideas, found no bar between his nature and their
sympathies.</p>

<p>In his treatment of chivalrous love we may notice this tendency to
generalization. The material transmitted from the troubadours, handled
with affectation by the Sicilians, philosophized by the Florentines,
loses transient and specific quality in the <i>Canzoniere</i>. It takes rank
at last among simply human emotions; and, though it has not lost a
certain medieval tincture, the <i>Canzoniere</i> rather than the <i>Vita
Nuova</i>, the work of distinguished rather than of supreme genius, has on
this account been understood and appropriated by all lovers in all ages
and in every land. Petrarch's verses, to use Shelley's words, &quot;are as
spells, which unseal the inmost enchanted fountains of the delight which
is the grief of love.&quot; And while we admit that &quot;Dante understood the
secrets of love even more than Petrarch,&quot; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">-90-</a></span> is no doubt that the
<i>Canzoniere</i> strikes a note which vibrates more universally than the
<i>Vita Nuova</i>. The majority of men cannot but prefer the comprehensive to
the intense expression of personal emotion.</p>

<p>Death rendered Beatrice's apotheosis conceivable; and Dante may be said
to have rediscovered the Platonic mystery, whereby love is an initiation
into the secrets of the spiritual world. It was the intuition of a
sublime nature into the essence of pure impersonal enthusiasm. It was an
exaltation of womanhood similar to that attempted less adequately by
Shelley in <i>Epipsychidion</i>. It was a real instinct like that which
pervades the poetry of Michelangelo, and which sustains some men even in
our prosaic age. Still there remained an ineradicable unsubstantiality
in Dante's point of view, when tested by the common facts of feeling.
His idealism was too far removed from ordinary experience to take firm
hold upon the modern mind. In proportion as Beatrice personified
abstractions, she ceased to be a woman even for her lover; nor was it
possible, except by diminishing her individuality, to regard her as a
symbol of the universal. She passed from the sphere of the human into
the divine; and though her face was still beautiful, it was the face of
Science rather than of one we love. There was even too little alloy of
earth in Dante's passion for Beatrice.</p>

<p>Petrarch's love for Laura was of a different type. The unrest of earthly
desire, for ever thwarted but recurring with imperious persistence, and
the rebellion of the conscience against emotions which the lover
recognized as lawless, broke his peace. It is true that, using the
language of the earlier poets and obey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">-91-</a></span>ing a sanguine mood of his own
mind, he from time to time spoke of Laura as of one who led his soul to
God. But his sincerest utterances reveal the discord of a heart divided
between duty and inclination, the melancholy of a man who knows himself
the prey of warring powers. His love for Laura seemed an error and a sin
because it clashed with an ascetic impulse which had never been
completely blunted. In his Hymn to the Virgin he referred to this
passion as the Medusa that had turned his better self to stone:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
Medusa e l'error mio m'han fatto un sasso<br />
D'umor van stillante.
</td>

</table>

<p>There is a passage in the <i>De Remediis utriusque Fortun&#230;</i>, where the
lyrist of chivalrous love pours such contempt on women as his friend
Boccaccio might have envied. In the <i>Secretum</i>, again, he describes his
own emotion as a torment from which he had vainly striven to emancipate
himself by solitude, by journeys, by distractions, and by obstinate
studies. In truth, he rarely alludes to the great passion of his life
without a strange blending of tenderness and sore regret. Herein he
proved himself not only a true child of his age, but also the precursor
of the modern world. While he was still bound by the traditions of
medieval asceticism, a Christian no less devout and only less firm than
Dante, his senses and his imagination, stirred possibly by contact with
classic literature, rebelled against the mysticism of the Florentine
School. This rebellion, but dimly apprehended by the poet himself, and
complicated with the yearnings of a deeply religious nature after purity
of thought and deed, gave its supreme strength and beauty to his verse.
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">-92-</a></span> <i>Canzoniere</i> is not merely the poetry of love but the poetry of
conflict also. The men of the Renaissance overleaped the conflict, and
satisfied themselves with empty idealizations of sensual desire. But
modern men have returned to Petrarch's point of view and found an echo
of their own divided spirit in his poetry. He marks the transition from
a medieval to a modern mood, the passage from Cino and Guido to Werther
and Rousseau.</p>

<p>That Laura was a real woman, and that Petrarch's worship of her was
unfeigned; that he adored her with the senses and the heart as well as
with the head; but that this love was at the same time more a mood of
the imagination, a delicate disease, a cherished wound, to which he
constantly recurred as the most sensitive and lively wellspring of
poetic fancy, than a downright and impulsive passion, may be clearly
seen in the whole series of his poems and his autobiographical
confessions. Laura appears to have treated him with the courtesy of a
somewhat distant acquaintance, who was aware of his homage and was
flattered by it. But her lover enjoyed no privileges of intimacy, and it
may be questioned whether, if Petrarch could by any accident have made
her his own, the fruition of her love would not have been a serious
interruption to the happiness of his life. He first saw her in the
church of S. Claire, at Avignon, on April 6, 1327. She passed from this
world on April 6, 1348. These two dates are the two turning-points of
Petrarch's life. The interval of twenty-one years, when Laura trod the
earth, and her lover in all his wanderings paid his orisons to her at
morning, evening, and noonday, and passed his nights in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">-93-</a></span> dreams of that
fair form which never might be his, was the storm and stress period of
his checkered career. There is an old Greek proverb that &quot;to desire the
impossible is a malady of the soul.&quot; With this malady in its most
incurable form the poet was stricken; and, instead of seeking cure, he
nursed his sickness and delighted in the discord of his spirit. From
that discord he wrought the harmonies of his sonnets and <i>canzoni</i>. That
malady made him the poet of all men who have found in their emotions a
dreamland more wonderful and pregnant with delight than in the world
which we call real. After Laura's death his love was tranquilized to a
sublimer music. The element of discord had passed out of it; and just
because its object was now physically unattainable, it grew in purity
and power. The sensual alloy which, however spiritualized, had never
ceased to disturb his soul, was purged from his still vivid passion.
Laura in heaven looked down upon him from her station mid the saints;
and her poet could indulge the dream that now at last she pitied him,
that she was waiting for him with angelic eyes of love, and telling him
to lose no time, but set his feet upon the stairs that led to God and
her. The romance finds its ultimate apotheosis in that transcendent
passage of the <i>Trionfo della Morte</i> which describes her death and his
own vision. Throughout the whole course of this labyrinthine
love-lament, sustained for forty years on those few notes so subtly
modulated, from the first sonnet on his <i>primo giovenile errore</i> to the
last line of her farewell, <i>tu starai in terra senza me gran tempo</i>,
Laura grows in vividness before us. She only becomes a real woman in
death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">-94-</a></span> because she was for Petrarch always an ideal, and in the ideal
world beyond the tomb he is more sure of her than when &quot;the fair veil&quot;
of flesh was drawn between her and his yearning.</p>

<p>Petrarch succeeded in bringing the old theme of chivalrous love back
from the philosophizing mysticism of the Florentines to simple
experience. He forms a link between their transcendental science and the
positive romance of the Decameron, between the spirit of the middle ages
and the spirit of the Renaissance. Guided by his master, Cino da
Pistoja, the least metaphysical and clearest of his immediate
predecessors, Petrarch found the right artistic <i>via media</i>; and perhaps
we may attribute something to that double education which placed him
between the influences of the Tuscan lyrists and the troubadours of his
adopted country. At any rate he returned from the allegories of the
Florentine poets to the directness of chivalrous emotion; but he treated
the original motive with a greater richness and a more idealizing
delicacy than his Proven&#231;al predecessors. The marvelous instruments of
the Italian Sonnet and Canzone were in his hands, and he knew how to
draw from them a purer if not a grander melody than either Guido or
Dante. The best work of the Florentines required a commentary; and the
structure of their verse, like its content, was scientific rather than
artistic. Petrarch could publish his <i>Canzoniere</i> without explanatory
notes. He laid his heart bare to the world, and every man who had a
heart might understand his language. Between the subject-matter and the
verbal expression there lay no intervening veil of mystic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">-95-</a></span> meaning. The
form had become correspondingly more clear and perfect, more harmonious
in its proportions, more immediate in musical effects. In a word,
Petrarch was the first to open a region where art might be free, and to
find for the heart's language utterance direct and limpid.</p>

<p>This was his great achievement. The forms he used were not new. The
subject-matter he handled was given to him. But he brought both form and
subject closer to the truth, exercising at the same time an art which
had hitherto been unconceived in subtlety, and which has never since
been equaled. If Dante was the first great poet, Petrarch was the first
true artist of Italian literature. It was, however, impossible that
Petrarch should overleap at one bound all the barriers of the middle
ages. His Laura has still something of the earlier ideality adhering to
her. She stands midway between the Beatrice of Dante and the women of
Boccaccio. She is not so much a woman with a character and personality,
as woman in the general, <i>la femme</i>, personified and made the object of
a poet's reveries. Though every detail of her physical perfections, with
the single and striking exception of her nose, is carefully recorded, it
is not easy to form a definite picture even of her face and shape. Of
her inner nature we hear only the vaguest generalities. She sits like a
lovely model in the midst of a beautiful landscape, like one of our
Burne-Jones's women who incarnate a mood of feeling while they lack the
fullness of personality. The thought of her pervades the valley of
Vaucluse; the perfume of her memory is in the air we breathe. But if we
met her, we should find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">-96-</a></span> it hard to recognize her; and if she spoke, we
should not understand that it was Laura.</p>

<p>Petrarch had no strong objective faculty. Just as he failed to bring
Laura vividly before us, until she had by death become a part of his own
spiritual substance, so he failed to depict things as he saw them. The
pictures etched in three or four lines of the <i>Purgatorio</i> may be sought
for vainly in his <i>Rime</i>. That his love of nature was intense, there is
no doubt. The solitary of Vaucluse, the pilgrim of Mont Ventoux, had
reached a point of sensibility to natural scenery far in advance of his
age. But when he came to express this passion for beauty, he was
satisfied with giving the most perfect form to the emotion stirred in
his own subjectivity. Instead of scenes, he delineates the moods
suggested by them. He makes the streams and cliffs and meadows of
Vaucluse his confidants. He does not lose himself in contemplation of
the natural object, though we feel that this self found its freest
breathing-space, its most delightful company, in the society of hill and
vale. He never cares to paint a landscape, but contents himself with
such delicate touches and such cunning combinations of words as may
suggest a charm in the external world. At this point the humanist,
preoccupied with man as his main subject, meets the poet in Petrarch.
What is lost, too, in the precision of delineation, is gained in
universality. The <i>Canzoniere</i> reminds us of no single spot; wherever
there are clear fresh rills and hanging mountains, the lover walks with
Petrarch by his side.</p>

<p>If the poet's dominant subjectivity weakened his grasp upon external
things, it made him supreme in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">-97-</a></span> self-portraiture. Every mood of passion
is caught and fixed precisely in his verse. The most evanescent shades
of feeling are firmly set upon the exquisite picture. Each string of
Love's many-chorded lyre is touched with a vigorous hand. The
fluctuations of hope, despair, surprise; the &quot;yea and nay twinned in a
single breath;&quot; the struggle of conflicting aspirations in a heart drawn
now to God and now to earth; the quiet resting-places of content; the
recrudescence of the ancient smart; the peace of absence, when longing
is luxury; the agony of presence, adding fire to fire&#8212;all this is
rendered with a force so striking, in a style so monumental, that the
<i>Canzoniere</i> may still be called the Introduction to the Book of Love.
Thus, when Petrarch's own self was the object, his hand was steady; his
art failed not in modeling the image into roundness.</p>

<p>Dante brought the universe into his poem. But &quot;the soul of man, too, is
a universe:&quot; and of this inner microcosm Petrarch was the poet. It
remained for Boccaccio, the third in the triumvirate, to treat of common
life with art no less developed. From Beatrice through Laura to La
Fiammetta; from the Divine Comedy through the Canzoniere to the
Decameron; from the world beyond the grave through the world of feeling
to the world in which we play our puppet parts; from the mystic <i>terza
rima</i>, through the stately lyric stanzas, to Protean prose&#8212;such was the
rapid movement of Italian art within the brief space of some fifty
years.</p>

<p>Giovanni Boccaccio was born in 1313, the eleventh year of Dante's exile,
the first of Petrarch's residence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">-98-</a></span> at Avignon. His grandfather belonged
originally to Certaldo; but he removed to Florence and received the
rights of burghership among those countryfolk whom Dante reckoned the
corrupters of her ancient commonwealth<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>:</p>

<p>Certaldo was a village of Valdelsa, famous for its onions. This explains
the rebuff which the author of the Decameron received from a Florentine
lady, whom he afterwards satirized in the <i>Corbaccio</i>: &quot;Go back to grub
your onion-beds, and leave gentlewomen alone!&quot; Boccaccio was neither
born in wedlock nor yet of pure Italian blood. His mother was a
Frenchwoman, with whom his father made acquaintance during a residence
on business at Paris. These facts deserve to be noted, since they bear
upon the temper of his mind and on the quality of his production.</p>

<p>It has been observed that the three main elements of Florentine
society&#8212;the <i>popolo vecchio</i>, or nobles who acquiesced in the
revolution of 1282; the <i>popolo grasso</i>, or burghers occupying a middle
rank in the city, who passed the Ordinances of 1293; and the <i>popolo
minuto</i>, or artisans and <i>contadini</i> admitted to the franchise, who came
to the front between 1343 and 1378&#8212;are severally represented by Dante,
Petrarch, and Boccaccio.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> So rapid are the political and intellectual
mutations in a little state like Florence, where the vigor of popular
life and the vivacity of genius bear <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">-99-</a></span>no proportion to the size of the
community, that within the short span of fifty years the center of power
may be transferred from an aristocracy to the proletariate, and the
transition in art and literature from the Middle Age to the Renaissance
may not only be accomplished but copiously illustrated in detail.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Boccaccio was the typical Italian <i>bourgeois</i>, the representative of a
class who finally determined the Renaissance. His prose and poetry
contain in germ the various species which were perfected during that
period. Studying him, we study in its immaturity the spirit of the next
two centuries. He was the first to substitute a literature of the people
for the literature of the learned classes and the aristocracy. He freed
the natural instincts from ascetic interdictions and the mysticism of
the transcendental school. He exposed the shams of chivalrous romance
and the hypocrisies of monkery with ridicule more deadly than satire or
invective. He brought realism in art and letters back to honor by
delineating the world as he found it&#8212;sensual, base, comic, ludicrous,
pathetic, tender, cruel&#8212;in all its crudities and contradictions. He
replaced the abstractions of the allegory by concrete fact. He
vindicated the claims of appetite and sensuous enjoyment against ideal
aspirations and the scruples of a faith-tormented conscience. He taught
his fellow-countrymen that a life of studious indifference was
preferable to the strife of factions and the din of battle-fields.</p>

<p>Boccaccio did not act consciously and with fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">-100-</a></span> purpose to these ends.
He was rather the spokesman of his age and race&#8212;the sign in literature
that Italian society had entered upon a new phase, and that the old
order was passing away. If the Decameron seemed to shake the basis of
morality; if it gained the name of <i>Il Principe Galeotto</i> or the Pandar;
if it was denounced as the corrupter of the multitude; this meant, not
that its author had a sinister intention, but that the medieval fabric
was already sapped, and that the people whom Boccaccio wrote to please
were disillusioned of their previous ideals. The honest easy-going man,
Giovanni della Tranquillit&#224;, as he was called, painted what he saw and
made himself the mouthpiece of the men around him.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>For the work he had to do, he was admirably fitted by nature and
education. He combined the blood of a Florentine tradesman and a
Parisian <i>grisette</i>. He had but little learning in his youth, and was
the first great Italian writer who had not studied at Bologna. His early
manhood was passed in commerce at Naples, where he gained access to the
dissolute Court of Joan, and made love to her ladies. At his father's
request he applied himself for a short while to legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">-101-</a></span> studies; but he
does not appear to have practiced as a lawyer in real earnest.
Literature very early became the passion, the one serious and ennobling
enthusiasm of his life. We have already seen him at the tomb of Virgil,
vowing to devote his powers to the sacred Muses; and we know what
services he rendered to humanism by his indefatigable energy in the
acquisition and diffusion of miscellaneous learning.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> This is not the
place to treat of Boccaccio's scholarship. Yet it may be said that, just
as his philosophy of life was the philosophy of a jovial and sensuous
plebeian, so his conception of literature lacked depth and greatness. He
repeated current theories about the dependence of poetry on truth, the
dignity of allegory, the sacredness of love, the beauty of honor. But
his own work showed how little he had appropriated these ideas. As a
student, a poet, and a man, he lived upon a lower plane of thought than
Petrarch; and when he left the concrete for the abstract, his
penetrative insight failed him.</p>

<p>From this point of view Boccaccio's Life of Dante is instructive. It is
crammed with heterogeneous erudition. It bristles with citations and
opinions learned by rote. It reveals the heartiest reverence for all
things reckoned worthy in the realm of intellect. The admiration for the
divine poet expressed in it is sincere and ungrudging. Yet this book
betrays an astonishing want of sympathy with Dante, and transforms the
sublime romance of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> into a commonplace <i>novella</i>. Dante
told the world how he first felt love for Beatrice at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">-102-</a></span> the age of nine.
His biographer is at a loss to understand this miracle. He supposes that
the sweet season of May, the good wines and delicate dishes of the
Portinari banquet, all the sensuous delights of a Florentine festival,
combined to make the boy prematurely a man.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Dante called Beatrice
&quot;youngest of the angels.&quot; Boccaccio draws a lively picture of an angel
in the flesh, as he imagined her; and in his portrait there is far less
of the angelic than the carnal nature visible. This he does in perfect
good faith, with the heartfelt desire to exalt Dante above all poets,
and to spread abroad the truth of his illustrious life. But the hero of
Renaissance literature was incapable of comprehending the real feeling
of the man he worshiped. Between him and the enthusiasms of the middle
ages a nine-fold Styx already poured its waves.</p>

<p>Boccaccio's noblest quality was the recognition of intellectual power.
It was this cult of great men, if we may trust Filippo Villani, which
first decided him to follow literature.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> His devotion to the memory
of Dante, and his frank confession of inferiority to Petrarch, whom he
loved and served through twenty years of that exacting poet's life, are
equally sincere and beautiful. These feelings inspired some of his
finest poems, and penetrated the autobiographical passages of his minor
works with a delicacy that endears the man to us.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> No less candid was
his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">-103-</a></span>worship of beauty&#8212;not beauty of an intellectual or ideal order,
but sensuous and real&#8212;the beauty which inspired the artists and the
poets of the following centuries. Nor has any writer of any age been
gifted with a stronger faculty for its expression. From this service of
the beautiful he derived the major impulse of his activity as an artist.
If he lacked moral greatness, if he was deficient in philosophical depth
and religious earnestness, his devotion to art was serious, intense,
profound, absorbing. He discharged his duties as a citizen with easy
acquiescence, but no stern consciousness of patriotic purpose. He
conformed to the Church, and allowed himself in old age to be frightened
into a kind of half-repentance. But the homage he rendered to art was of
a very different and more exacting nature. With his best energies he
labored to make himself, at least in this sphere, perfect. How amply he
succeeded must be acknowledged by all men who have read the Decameron,
and who have seen that here Boccaccio forms the legends of all ages and
all lands into one harmonious whole, brings a world of many-sided human
interest and varied beauty out of the chaos of medieval materials,
finishing every detail with love, inspiring each particle with life, and
setting the d&#230;dal picture of society in a framework of delicate romance.
The conception and the execution of this masterpiece of literature are
equally artistic. If the phrase &quot;art for art&quot; can be used in speaking of
one who was unconscious of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">-104-</a></span> theory it implies, Boccaccio may be
selected as the typical artist for art's sake. Within the sphere of his
craft, he is impassioned, enthusiastic, sincere, profound. His attitude
with regard to all else is one of amused or curious indifference, of
sensuous enjoyment, of genial ridicule, of playful cynicism.</p>

<p>Boccaccio was a <i>bourgeois</i> of the fourteenth century; but his
character, as stamped on the Decameron, was common to Italy during the
next two hundred years. The whole book glows with the joyousness of a
race discarding dreams for realities, scorning the terrors of a bygone
creed, reveling in nature's liberty, proclaiming the empire of the
senses with a frankness which passes over into license. In Boccaccio,
the guiding genius of the Italian Renaissance arrives at consciousness.
That blending of moral indifference with artistic seriousness, which we
observe in him, marks the coming age. He is not the precursor but the
inaugurator of the era. The smile which plays around his mouth became,
though changeful in expression, fixed upon the lips of his
posterity&#8212;genial in Ariosto, gracious in Poliziano, mischievous in
Pulci, dubious in Lorenzo de' Medici, sardonic in Aretino, bitter in
Folengo, toned to tragic irony in Machiavelli, impudent in Berni, joyous
in Boiardo, sensual in Bandello&#8212;assuming every shade of character,
Protean, indescribable, until at last it fades from Tasso's brow, when
Italy has ceased to laugh except in secret.</p>

<p>The Decameron has been called the <i>Commedia Umana</i>.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> This title is
appropriate, not merely because the book portrays human life from a
comic rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">-105-</a></span> a serious point of view, but also because it is the
antithesis of Dante's <i>Commedia Divina</i>. As poet and scene-painter
devised for our ancestors of the Elizabethan period both Mask and
Anti-mask, so did the genius of Italy provide two shows for modern
Europe&#8212;the Mask and Anti-mask of human nature. Dante's Comedy
represents our life in relation to the life beyond the grave. Boccaccio
in his Comedy depicts the life of this earth only, subtracting
whatsoever may suggest a life to come. It would be difficult to
determine which of the two dramas is the more truthful, or which of the
two poets had a firmer grasp upon reality. But the realities of the
Divine Comedy are spiritual; those of the Human Comedy are material. The
world of the Decameron is not an inverted world, like that of
Aristophanes. It does not antithesize Dante's world by turning it upside
down. It is simply the same world surveyed from an opposite point of
view&#8212;unaltered, uninverted, but seen in the superficies, presented in
the concrete. It is the prose of life; and this justifies the
counterpoise of its form to that of Dante's poem. It is the world as
world, the flesh as flesh, nature as nature, without intervention of
spiritual agencies, without relation to ideal order, regarded as the
sphere of humor, fortune, marvelous caprice. It is everything which the
Church had banned, proscribed, held in abhorrence, without that which
the Church had inculcated for the exaltation of the soul. This world,
actual and unexplained, Boccaccio paints with the mastery of an
accomplished artist, molding its chaotic elements into a form of beauty
which compels attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">-106-</a></span></p>

<p>Dante condemned those &quot;who submit their reason to natural appetite.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Boccaccio celebrates the apotheosis of natural appetite, of <i>il
talento</i>, stigmatized as sin by ascetic Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> His strongest
sympathies are reserved for those who suffer by abandoning themselves to
impulse, and in this self-abandonment he sees the poetry of life. This
is the very core of the antithesis presented by the Human to the Divine
Comedy. The Decameron is an undesigned revolt against the sum of
medieval doctrine. Like all vehement reactions, it is not satisfied with
opposing the extravagances of the view it combats. Instead of negativing
asceticism, it affirms license. Yet though the Divine Comedy and the
Decameron are antithetical, they are both true, and true together,
inasmuch as they present the same humanity studied under contradictory
conditions. Human nature is vast enough to furnish the materials for
both, inexplicable enough to render both acceptable to reason, tolerant
enough to view with impartial approbation the desolate theology of the
<i>Inferno</i> and the broad mirth of the Decameron.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">-107-</a></span></p><p>The Decameron did not appear unheralded by similar attempts. No
literary taste was stronger in the middle ages than the taste for
stories. This is proved by the collection known as <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>,
and by the <i>Bestiarii</i>, <i>Lapidarii</i>, <i>Physiologi</i> and <i>Apiarii</i>, which
contain a variety of tales, many of them surprisingly indecent, veiling
spiritual doctrine under obscenities which horrify a modern reader.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
From the hands of ecclesiastical compilers these short stories passed
down to popular narrators, who in France made the <i>fabliaux</i> a special
branch of vulgar literature. The follies and vices of the clergy, tricks
practiced by wives upon their husbands, romantic adventures of lovers,
and comic incidents of daily life, formed the staple of their stock in
trade. When the <i>fabliau</i> reached Italy, together with other literary
wares, from France, it was largely cultivated in the South; and the
first known collection of Italian stories received the name of <i>Il
Novellino</i>, or <i>Il Fiore del parlar gentile</i>. The language of this book
was immature, and the tales themselves seem rather memoranda for the
narrator than finished compositions to be read with pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> It may
therefore be admitted that the rude <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">-108-</a></span>form of the Decameron was given to
Boccaccio. Not to mention the larger chivalrous romances, <i>Conti di
antichi Cavalieri</i>, and translations from French <i>Chansons de Geste</i>,
which have no genuine link of connection with the special type of the
Novella, he found models for his tales both in the libraries of medieval
convents and upon the lips of popular <i>raccontatori</i>. Yet this must not
be taken to imply any lack of originality in Boccaccio. Such comparisons
as Professor Bartoli has instituted between the Decameron and some of
its supposed sources, prove the insignificance of his debt, the
immeasurable inferiority of his predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>The spirit of the Decameron no less than the form, had been long in
preparation. Satire, whether superficial, as in the lays of the
<i>jongleurs</i>, or searching, as in the invectives of Dante and Petrarch,
was familiar to the middle ages; and the popular Latin poems of the
wandering students are steeped in rage against a corrupt hierarchy, a
venal Curia.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Those same <i>Car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">-109-</a></span>mina Vagorum</i> reveal the smoldering
embers of unextinguished Paganism, which underlay the Christian culture
of the middle ages. Written by men who belonged to the clerical classes,
but who were often on bad terms with ecclesiastical authorities,
tinctured with the haughty contempt of learning for the laity, yet
overflowing with the vigorous life of the proletariate, these
extraordinary poems bring to view a bold and candid sensuality, an
ineradicable spontaneity of natural appetite, which is strangely at
variance with the cardinal conceptions of ascetic Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In
the sect of the Italian Epicureans; in the obscure bands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">-110-</a></span> the Cathari
and Paterini; in the joyous companies of Proven&#231;al Court and castle, the
same note of irrepressible nature sounded. Side by side with the
new-built fabric of ecclesiastical idealism, the old temples of
unregenerate human deities subsisted. They were indeed discredited,
proscribed, consigned to shame. They formed the <i>mauvais lieux</i> of
Christendom. Yet there they stood, even as the Venusberg of Tannh&#228;user's
legend abode unshaken though cathedrals rose by Rhine. All that was
needed to restore the worship of these nature-gods was that a great
artist should decorate their still substantial temple-walls with the
beauty of a new, sincere, and unrepentant style, fitting their abandoned
chambers for the habitation of the human spirit, free now to choose the
dwelling that it listed. This Boccaccio achieved. And here it must again
be noticed that the revolution of time was about to bring man's popular
and carnal deities once more, if only for a season, to the throne. The
murmured songs of a few wandering students were about to be drowned in
the p&#230;an of Renaissance poetry. The visions of the Venusberg were to be
realized in Italian painting. The coming age was destined to live out
Boccaccio's Human Comedy in act and deed. This is the true kernel of his
greatness. As poet, he ranked third only, and that at a vast interval,
in the triumvirate of the fourteenth century. But the temper of his
mind, the sphere of his conceptions, made him the representative genius
of the two following centuries. Awaiting the age when science should
once more co-ordinate the forces of humanity in a coherent theory, men
in the Renaissance exchanged superfluous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">-111-</a></span> restraint for immoderate
license. It is not to be wondered at that Boccaccio and not Dante was
their hero.</p>

<p>The description of the Plague at Florence which introduces the
Decameron, has more than a merely artistic appropriateness. Boccaccio
may indeed have meant to bring his group of pleasure-seeking men and
maidens into strong relief by contrast with the horrors of the stricken
city. Florence crowded with corpses, echoing to the shrieks of delirium
and the hoarse cries of body-buriers, is the background he has chosen
for that blooming garden, where the birds sing and the lovers sit by
fountains in the shade, laughing or weeping as the spirit of each tale
compels them. But independently of this effect of contrast, which might
be used to illustrate the author's life-philosophy, the description of
the Plague has a still deeper significance, whereof Boccaccio never
dreamed. Matteo Villani dates a progressive deterioration of manners in
the city from the Plague of 1348, and justifies us in connecting the
Ciompi riots of 1378 with the enfeeblement of civic order during those
thirty years. The Plague was, therefore, the outward sign, if not the
efficient cause, of those very ethical and social changes which the
Decameron immortalized in literature. It was the historical landmark
between two ages, dividing the Florence of the Grandi from the Florence
of the Ciompi. The cynicism, liberated in that time of terror,
lawlessness, and sudden death, assumed in Boccaccio's romance a
beautiful and graceful aspect. It lost its harsh and vulgar outlines,
and took the air of genial indulgence which distinguished Italian
society throughout the years of the Renaissance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">-112-</a></span></p>

<p>Boccaccio selects seven ladies of ages varying from eighteen to
twenty-eight, and three men, the youngest of whom is twenty-five. Having
formed this company, he transports them to a villa two miles from the
city, where he provides them with a train of serving-men and
waiting-women, and surrounds them with the delicacies of medieval
luxury. He is careful to remind us that, though the three men and three
of the ladies were acknowledged lovers, and though their conversation
turned on almost nothing else but passion, &quot;no stain defiled the honor
of the party.&quot; Stories are told; and these unblemished maidens listen
with laughter and a passing blush to words and things which outrage
Northern sense of decency. The remorseless but light satire of the
Decameron spares none of the ideals of the age. All the medieval
enthusiasms are reviewed and criticised from the standpoint of the
Florentine <i>bottega</i> and <i>piazza</i>. It is as though the <i>bourgeois</i>, not
content with having made nobility a crime, were bent upon extinguishing
its spirit. The tale of Agilulf vulgarizes the chivalrous conception of
love ennobling men of low estate, by showing how a groom, whose heart is
set upon a queen, avails himself of opportunity. Tancredi burlesques the
knightly reverence for a stainless scutcheon by the extravagance of his
revenge. The sanctity of the Thebaid, that ascetic dream of purity and
self-renunciation for God's service, is made ridiculous by Alibech. Ser
Ciappelletto brings contempt upon the canonization of saints. The
confessional, the worship of relics, the priesthood, and the monastic
orders are derided with the deadliest persiflage. Christ him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">-113-</a></span>self is
scoffed at in a jest which points the most indecent of these tales.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
Marriage affords a never-failing theme for scorn; and when, by way of
contrast, the novelist paints an ideal wife, he runs into such
hyperboles that the very patience of Griselda is a satire on its
dignity. Like Balzac, Boccaccio was unsuccessful in depicting virtuous
womanhood. Attempting this, he fell, like Balzac, into the absurdities
of sentiment. His own conception of love was sensual and voluptuous&#8212;not
uniformly coarse, nay often tender, but frankly carnal. Without having
recourse to the Decameron, this statement might be abundantly
substantiated by reference to the <i>Filostrato</i>, <i>Fiammetta</i>, <i>Amorosa
Visione</i>, <i>Ninfale Fiesolano</i>. Boccaccio enjoyed the painting of
licentious pleasure, snatched in secret, sometimes half by force, by a
lover after moderate resistance from his paramour. He imported into
these pictures the plebeian tone which we have already noticed in the
popular poetry of the preceding century, and which was destined to
pervade the erotic literature of the Renaissance. There is, therefore,
an ironical contrast between the decencies observed by his <i>brigata</i> and
their conversation; a contrast rooted in the survival from chivalrous
times of conventional ideals, which have lost reality and been
persistently ignored in practice. This effect of irony is enhanced by
the fact that many of the motives are such as might have been
romantically treated, but here are handled from the <i>popolano grasso's</i>
point of view. A skeptical and sensuous imagination plays around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">-114-</a></span>
sanctities and sublimities which have for it become illusory.</p>

<p>We observe the same kind of unconscious hypocrisy, the same spontaneous
sapping of now obsolete ideals, in the <i>Amorosa Visione</i>.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Here Love
is still regarded as the apotheosis of mortal experience. It is still
said to be the union of intelligence and moral energy in an enthusiasm
of the soul. Yet the joys of love revealed at the conclusion of the poem
are such as a <i>bayad&#232;re</i> might offer.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The <i>bourgeois</i> effaces the
knight; the Italian of the Renaissance has broken the leading strings of
mystical romance. This vision, composed in <i>terza rima</i>, was assuredly
not meant to travesty Dante. Still it would be difficult to imagine a
more complete inversion of the Dantesque point of view, a more
deliberate substitution of an Earthly Paradise for the Paradiso of the
Divine Comedy. It is as though Boccaccio, the representative of the new
age, in all the fullness of his sensuous <i>na&#239;vet&#233;</i>, appealed to the
poets of chivalry, and said: &quot;See here how all your fancies find their
end in nature!&quot;</p>

<p>It will not do to over-strain the censure implied in the foregoing
paragraphs. Natural appetite, no less than the ideal, has its elements
of poetry; and the sensuality of the Decameron accords with plastic
beauty in a work of art incomparably lucid. Shelley, no lenient critic,
wrote these words about the setting of the tales<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>: &quot;What descriptions
of nature are those in his little introductions to every new day! It is
the morning of life stripped of that mist of familiarity <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">-115-</a></span>which makes it
obscure to us.&quot; Boccaccio's sense of beauty has already been alluded to;
and it so pervades his work that special attention need scarcely be
called to it. His prose abounds in passages which are perfect pictures
after their own kind, like the following, selected, not from the
Decameron, but from an earlier work, entitled <i>Filocopo</i><a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Con gli orecchi intenti al suono, cominci&#242; ad andare in quella
parte ove il sentiva; e giunto presso alla fontana, vide le
due giovinette. Elle erano nel viso bianchissime, la quale
bianchezza quanto si conveniva di rosso colore era mescolata.
I loro occhi pareano mattutine stelle, e le picciole bocche di
colore di vermiglia rosa, pi&#249; piacevoli diveniano nel muoverle
alle note della loro canzone. I loro capelli come fila d'oro
erano biondissimi, i quali alquanto crespi s'avvolgevano infra
le verdi frondi delle loro ghirlande. Vestite per lo gran
caldo, come &#232; detto sopra, le tenere e dilicate carni di
sottilissimi vestimenti, i quali dalla cintura in su
strettissimi mostravano la forma delle belle mamme, le quali
come due ritondi pomi pignevano in fuori il resistente
vestimento, e ancora in pi&#249; luoghi per leggiadre apriture si
manifestavano le candide carni. La loro statura era di
convenevole grandezza, in ciascun membro bene proporzionata.</p>

<p>Space and nineteenth-century canons of propriety prevent me from
completing the picture made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">-116-</a></span> Florio and these maidens. It might be
paralleled with a hundred passages of like intention, where the Italian
artist is revealed to us by touches curiously multiplied.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> We find in
them the sense of color, the scrupulous precision of form, and something
of that superfluous minuteness which belongs to painting rather than to
literature. The writer has seen a picture, and not felt a poem. In
rendering it by words, he trusted to the imagination of his reader for
suggesting a highly-finished work of plastic art to the mind.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The
<i>f&#234;tes champ&#234;tres</i> of the Venetian masters are here anticipated in the
prose of the <i>trecento</i>. Such descriptions were frequent in Italian
literature, especially frequent in the works of the best stylists,
Sannazzaro, Poliziano, Ariosto, the last of whom has been severely but
not unjustly criticised by Lessing for overstepping the limits of poetry
in his portrait of Alcina. It may be pleaded in defense of Boccaccio and
his followers that they belonged to a nation dedicated to the figurative
arts, and that they wrote for a public familiar with painted form. Their
detailed descriptions were at once translated into color by men
habituated to the sight of pictures. During the Renaissance, painting
dominated the Italian genius, and all the sister arts of expression felt
that influence, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">-117-</a></span>just as at Athens sculpture lent something even to the
drama.</p>

<p>As a poet, Boccaccio tried many styles. His epic, the <i>Teseide</i>, cannot
be reckoned a great success. He is not at home upon the battle-field,
and knew not how to sound the heroic trumpet.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Yet the credit of
discovery may be awarded to the author of this poem. He introduced to
the modern world a tale rich in romantic incidents and capable of still
higher treatment than he was himself able to give it. When we remember
how Chaucer, Shakspere, Fletcher and Dryden handled and rehandled the
episode of Palamon's rivalry with Arcite for the hand of Emilia, we dare
not withhold from Boccaccio the praise which belongs to creative
genius.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> It is no slight achieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">-118-</a></span>ment to have made a story which
bore such noble fruit in literature. The <i>Teseide</i>, moreover, fulfilled
an important mission in Italian poetry. It adapted the popular <i>ottava
rima</i> to the style of the romantic epic, and fixed it for Pulci,
Poliziano, Boiardo, and Ariosto. That Boccaccio was not the inventor of
the stanza, as used to be assumed, may now be considered beyond all
question. That he had not learned to handle it with the majestic
sweetness of Poliziano, or the infinite variety of Ariosto, is evident.
Yet he deserves credit for having discerned its capacity and brought it
into cultivated use.</p>

<p>Though unequal in quality, his sonnets and <i>ballate</i>, whether separately
published or scattered through his numerous prose works, have a higher
merit. The best are those in which, following Guido Cavalcanti's path,
he gives free scope to his incomparable sense of natural beauty. The
style is steeped in sweetness, softness and the delicacy of music. From
these half-popular poems I might select the Ballata <i>Io mi son
giovinetta</i>; the song of the Angel from the planet Venus, extracted from
the <i>Filocopo</i>; a lament of a woman for her lost youth, <i>Il fior che 'l
valor perde</i>; and the girl's prayer to Love, <i>Tu se' nostro Signor caro
e verace</i>.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> It is difficult for the critic to characterize poems so
true to simple nature, so spontaneously passionate, and yet so artful in
the turns of language, molded like wax beneath the poet's touch. Here
sensuousness has no vulgarity, and the seductions of the flesh are
sublimed by feeling to a beauty which is spiritual in refinement. It may
be observed that Boccaccio writes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">-119-</a></span> his best love-poetry to be sung by
girls. He has abandoned the standpoint of the chivalrous lover, though
he still uses the phraseology of the Italo-Proven&#231;al school. What
arrests his fancy is, not the ideal of womanhood raising man above
himself, but woman conscious of her own supreme attractiveness. He
delights in making her the mirror of the feelings she inspires. He bids
her celebrate in hymns the beauty of her sex, the perfume of the charms
that master man. When the metaphysical forms of speech, borrowed from
the elder style, are used, they give utterance to a passion which is
sensual, or blent at best with tenderness&#8212;a physical love-longing, a
sentiment born of youth and desire. A girl, for instance, speaks about
herself, and says:<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>On the lips of him who wrote the tale of Alibech, this language savors
of profanity. Yet we are forced to recognize the poet's sincerity of
feeling. It is the same problem as that which meets us in the <i>Amorosa
Visione</i>.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The god Boccaccio worshiped was changed: but this deity
was still divine, and deserved, he thought, the honors of mystic
adoration. At the same time there is nothing Asiatic in his sensuous
inspiration. The emotion is controlled and concentrated; the form is
pure in all its outlines.</p>

<p>The Decameron was the masterpiece of Boccaccio's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">-120-</a></span>maturity. But he did
not reach that height of excellence without numerous essays in styles of
much diversity. While still a young man, not long after his meeting with
Fiammetta, he began the <i>Filocopo</i> and dedicated it to his new
love.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> This romance was based upon the earlier tale of <i>Floire et
Blanceflor</i>.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> But the youthful poet invested the simple love-story
of his Florio and Biancofiore with a masquerade costume of mythological
erudition and wordy rhetoric, which removed it from the middle ages. The
gods and goddesses of Olympus are introduced as living agents, supplying
the machinery of the romance until the very end, when the hero and
heroine are converted to Christianity, and abjure their old protectors
with cold equanimity. We are left to imagine that, for Boccaccio at any
rate, Venus, Mars and Cupid were as real as Christ and the saints,
though superseded as objects of pious veneration. This confusion of
Pagan and Christian mythology is increased by his habit of finding
classical periphrases for the expression of religious ideas. He calls
nuns <i>Sacerdotesse di Diana</i>. God the Father is <i>Quell'eccelso e
inestimabile principe Sommo Giove</i>. Satan becomes Pluto, and human sin
is Atropos. The Birth of Christ is described thus: <i>la terra come sent&#236;
il nuovo incarco della deit&#224; del <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">-121-</a></span>figliuol di Giove</i>. The Apostles
appear as <i>nuovi cavalieri entrati contro a Plutone in campo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The
style of the <i>Filocopo</i> was new; and in spite, or perhaps because of,
its euphuism, it had a decided success. This encouraged Boccaccio to
attempt the <i>Teseide</i>. The <i>Filostrato</i> soon followed; and here for the
first time we find the future author of the Decameron. Under Greek names
and incidents borrowed from the War of Troy, we are in fact studying
some episode from the <i>chroniques galantes</i> of the Neapolitan Court,
narrated with the vigor of a perfect master in the art of story telling.
Nothing could be further removed in sentiment from the heroism of the
Homeric age or closer to the customs of a corrupt Italian city than this
poem. In Troilo himself a feverish type of character, overmastered by
passion which is rather a delirium of the senses than a mood of feeling,
has been painted with a force that reminds us of the <i>Fiammetta</i>, where
the same disease of the soul is delineated in a woman. Pandaro shows for
the first time in modern literature an utterly depraved nature, reveling
in seduction, and glutting a licentious imagination with the spectacle
of satiated lust. The frenzied appetite of Troilo, Pandaro's ruffian
arts, and the gradual yieldings of Griselda to a voluptuous inclination,
reveal the master's hand; and though the poem is hurried toward the
close (Boccaccio being only interested in the portrayal of his hero's
love-languors, ecstasies and disappointment), the <i>Filostrato</i> must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">-122-</a></span>
undoubtedly be reckoned the finest of his narratives in verse. The
second and third Cantos are remarkable for dramatic movement and wealth
of sensuous imagination, never rising to sublimity nor refined with such
poetry as Shakspere found for Romeo and Juliet, but welling copiously
from a genuinely ardent nature. The love described is nakedly and
unaffectedly luxurious; it is an overmastering impulse, crowned at last
with all the joys of sensual fruition. According to Boccaccio the repose
conferred by Love upon his votaries is the satiety of their
desires.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Between Dante's <i>Signore della nobilitade</i> and his <i>Sir di
tutta pace</i> there is indeed a wide gulf fixed.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>After the <i>Filostrato</i>, Boccaccio next produced the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">-123-</a></span><i>Ameto</i>, <i>Amorosa
Visione</i>, <i>Fiammetta</i>, <i>Ninfale Fiesolano</i>, and <i>Corbaccio</i>, between the
years 1343 and 1355. The <i>Ameto</i> is a tissue of pastoral tales,
descriptions, and versified interludes, prolix in style and affected
with pedantic erudition. To read it attentively is now almost
impossible, in spite of frequent passages where the luxuriant
word-painting of the author is conspicuous. In the <i>Amorosa Visione</i> he
attempted the style which Petrarch had adopted for his <i>Trionfi</i>. After
reviewing human life under the several aspects of learning, glory, love,
fortune, the poet finally resigns himself to a Nirvana of sensual
beatitude. The poem is unsuccessful, because it adapts an obsolete form
of art to requirements beyond its scope. Boccaccio tries to pour the new
wine of the Renaissance into the old bottles of medieval allegory. In
the <i>Fiammetta</i> Boccaccio exhibited all his strength as an anatomist of
feeling, describing the effects of passion in a woman's heart, and
analyzing its varying emotions with a subtlety which proved his
knowledge of a certain type of female character. It is the first attempt
in modern literature to portray subjective emotion exterior to the
writer. Since Virgil's Dido, or the <i>Heroidum Epistol&#230;</i> of Ovid, nothing
of the sort had been essayed upon an equal scale. Taken together with
Dante's <i>Vita Nuova</i> and Petrarch's <i>Secretum</i>, each of which is a
personal confidence, the <i>Fiammetta</i> may be reckoned among those
masterpieces of analytic art, which revealed the developed consciousness
of the Italian race, at a moment when the science of emotion was still
for the rest of Europe an undiscovered territory. This essay exercised a
wide and lasting influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">-124-</a></span> over the descriptive literature of the
Renaissance. Yet when we compare its stationary monologues with the
brief but pregnant touches of the Decameron, we are forced to assign it
the rank of a study rather than a finished picture. The <i>Fiammetta</i> is
to the Decameron what rhetoric is to the drama. This, however, is hardly
a deduction from its merit. The delineation of an unholy and unhappy
passion, blessed with fruition for one brief moment, cursed through
months of illness and despair with all the furies of vain desire and
poignant recollection, is executed with incomparable fullness of detail
and inexhaustible richness of fancy. The reader rises from a perusal of
the <i>Fiammetta</i> with impressions similar to those which a work of
Richardson leaves upon the mind. At the same time it is full of poetry.
The Vision of Venus, the invocation to Sleep, and the description of
summer on the Bay of Bai&#230; relieve a deliberate anatomy of passion, which
might otherwise be tedious.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The romance is so rich in material that
it furnished the motives for a score of tales, and the novelists of the
Renaissance availed themselves freely of its copious stores.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Corbaccio</i> or <i>Laberinto d'Amore</i> is a satire upon women, animated
with the bitterest sense of injury and teeming with vindictive spite. It
was written with the avowed purpose of reviling a lady who had rejected
Boccaccio's advances, and it paints the whole sex in the darkest colors.
We could fancy that certain passages had been penned by a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">-125-</a></span>disappointed
monk. Though this work is in tone unworthy of its author, it bore fruits
in the literature of the next century. Alberti's satires are but
rhetorical amplifications of themes suggested by the <i>Corbaccio</i>. Nor is
it without value for the student of Italian manners. The list of
romances read by women in the fourteenth century throws light upon
Francesca's episode in Dante, and proves that the title <i>Principe
Galeotto</i> was not given without precedent to Boccaccio's own
writings.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The discourse on gentle birth in the same treatise should
be studied in illustration of the Florentine conception of
nobility.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Boccaccio, though he follows so closely in time upon
Dante, already anticipates the democratic theories of Poggio.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
Feudal feeling was extinct in the <i>bourgeoisie</i> of the great towns; nor
had the experience of the Neapolitan Court suppressed in Boccaccio's
mind the pride of a Florentine citizen. At the same time he felt that
contempt of the literary classes for the common folk which was destined
in the next century to divide the nation and to check the development of
its vulgar literature. He apologizes for explaining Dante, and for
bringing poetry down to the level of the <i>feccia plebeia</i>, the <i>vulgo
indegno</i>, the <i>ingrati meccanici</i>, and so forth.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>It remains to speak of yet another of Boccaccio's minor works, the
<i>Ninfale Fiesolano</i>. This is a tale in octave stanzas, which, under a
veil of mythological romance, relates the loves of a young man and a
nun, and their subsequent tragic ending. It owes its in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">-126-</a></span>terest to the
vivid picture of seduction, so glowingly painted as to betray the
author's personal enjoyment of the motive. The story is thrown back into
a time antecedent to Christianity and civil life. The heroine, Mensola,
is a nymph of Diana; the hero, Affrico, a shepherd. The scene is laid
among the mountains above Florence; and when Mensola has been changed
into a fountain by the virgin goddess, whose rites she violated, the
poem concludes with a myth invented to explain the founding of Fiesole.
Civil society succeeds to the savagery of the woodland, and love is
treated as the vestibule to culture.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The romantic and legendary
portions of this tale are ill-connected. The versification is lax; and
except in the long episode of Mensola's seduction, which might have
formed a passage of contemporary novel-writing, the genius of Boccaccio
shines with clouded luster.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Yet the <i>Ninfale Fiesolano</i> occupies a
not unimportant place in the history of Italian literature. It adapts
the pastoral form to that ideal of civility dependent upon culture,
which took so strong a hold upon the imagination of the <i>cinque cento</i>.
Its stanzas are a forecast of the <i>Arcadia</i> and the <i>Orfeo</i>.</p>

<p>In the minor poems and romances, which have here been passed in review,
except perhaps in the <i>Fiammetta</i>, Boccaccio cannot be said to take a
place <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">-127-</a></span>among European writers of the first rank. His style is prolix;
his versification, if we omit the <i>Canzoni a Ballo</i> and some sonnets, is
slovenly; nor does he show exceptional ability in the conception and
conduct of his stories. He is strongest when he paints a violent passion
or describes voluptuous sensations, weakest when he attempts allegory or
assumes the airs of a philosopher. We feel, in reading these productions
of his earlier manhood, that nearly all were what the Germans call
<i>Gelegenheits-gedichte</i>. The private key is lost to some of these works,
which were intended for the ears of one among the multitude. On others
it is plainly written that they were the outpourings of a personal
desire, the self-indulgence of a fancy which reveled in imagined
sensuality, using literature as the safety-valve for subjective
longings. They lack the calm of perfect art, the full light falling on
the object from without, which marks a poem of the highest order. From
these romances of his youth, no less than from the Latin treatises of
his maturity, we return to the Decameron when we seek to place Boccaccio
among the classics. Nothing comparable with this Human Comedy for
universal interest had appeared in modern Europe, if we except the
Divine Comedy; and it may be questioned whether any work of equal scope
was given to the world before the theater of Shakspere and the comedies
of Moli&#232;re. Boccaccio, though he paints the surface of life, paints it
in a way to suggest the inner springs of character, and to bring the
motives of action vividly before us. <i>Quicquid agunt homines</i> is the
matter of his book. The recoil from medieval principles of conduct,
which gives it a certain air of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">-128-</a></span> belonging to a moment rather than all
time, was necessary in the evolution of intellectual freedom. In this
respect, again, it faithfully reflected the Florentine temperament. At
no epoch have the Italians been sternly and austerely pious. Piety with
them is a passionate impulse rather than a deeply-reasoned habit based
upon conviction. Their true nature is critical, susceptible to beauty,
quick at seizing the ridiculous and exposing shams, suspicious of
mysticism, realistic, pleasure-loving, practical. These qualities,
special to the Florentines, but shared in large measure by the nation,
found artistic expression in the Decameron, and asserted their supremacy
in the literature of the Renaissance. That a sublime ideal,
unapprehended by Boccaccio, and destined to remain unrepresented in the
future, should have been conceived by Dante; that Petrarch should have
modulated by his masterpiece of poetic workmanship from the key of the
Divine Comedy to that of the Decameron; that one city should have
produced three such men, and that one half-century should have witnessed
their successive triumphs, forms the great glory of Florence, and is one
of the most notable facts in the history of genius.</p>

<p>It remains to speak about Boccaccio's prose, and the relation of his
style to that of other <i>trecentisti</i>. If we seek the origins of Italian
prose, we find them first in the Franco-Italian romances of the Lombard
period, which underwent the process of <i>toscaneggiamento</i> at Florence,
next in books of morality and devotion, and also in the earlier
chronicles. Among the Tuscanized tales of chivalry belonging to the
first age of Italian literature are the <i>Conti di antichi cavalieri</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">-129-</a></span>
and the <i>Tavola Ritonda</i>, both of which bear traces of translation from
Proven&#231;al sources.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The <i>Novellino</i>, of which mention has already
been made, betrays the same origin. The style of these works offers a
pretty close parallel to the English of Sir Thomas Mallory. At the same
time that the literature of France was assuming an Italian garb, many
versions of Roman classics appeared. Orosius, Vegetius, Sallust, with
parts of Cicero, Livy and Boethius were adapted to popular reading. But
the taste of the time, as we have already seen in the preceding
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">chapter</a>,
inclined the authors of these works to make selections with a view to
moral edification. Their object was, not to present the ancients in a
modern garb, but to cull notable examples of conduct and ethical
sentences from the works that found most favor with the medieval
intellect. Passing under the general titles of <i>Fiori</i>, <i>Giardini</i>,
<i>Tesori</i> and <i>Conviti</i>&#8212;<i>Fiori di filosofi e molto savi</i>, <i>Giardino di
Consolazione</i>, <i>Fiore di Rettorica</i>, <i>Fiore del parlar gentile</i>&#8212;these
collections supplied the laity with extracts from Latin authors, and
extended culture to the people. The <i>Libro di Cato</i> might be chosen as a
fair example of their scope.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The number of such books, ascribed to
Bono Giamboni, Brunetto Latini, and Guidotto of Bologna, proves that an
extensive public was eager for instruction of this sort; and it is
reasonable to believe that they were studied by the artisans of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">-130-</a></span>central
Italy. The bass-reliefs and frescoes of incipient Italian art, the
pavement of the Sienese Cathedral, the Palazzo della Ragione at Padua,
bear traces of the percolation through all social strata of this
literature. A more important work of style was the <i>De Regimine
Principum</i>, of Egidio Colonna, translated from the French version by an
unknown Tuscan hand; while Giamboni's Florentine version of Latini's
<i>Tesoro</i> introduced the erudition of the most learned grammarian of his
age to the Italians. Contemporaneously with this growth of vernacular
treatises on rhetorical and ethical subjects, we may assume that memoirs
and chronicles began to be written in the vulgar tongue. But so much
doubt has recently been thrown upon the earliest monuments of Italian
historiography that it must here suffice to indicate the change which
was undoubtedly taking place in this branch also of composition toward
the close of the thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Literature of all kinds
yielded to the first strong impact of the native idiom. Epistles, for
example, whether of private or of public import, were now occasionally
written in Italian, as can be proved by reference to the published
letters of Guittone d'Arezzo.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The works hitherto mentioned belong to the latter half of the thirteenth
century. Their style, speaking <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">-131-</a></span>generally, is dry and tentative. Except
in the versions of French romances, which borrow grace from their
originals, we do not find in them artistic charm of diction. The <i>Fiori</i>
and <i>Giardini</i> are little better than commonplace books, in which the
author's personality is lost beneath a mass of extracts and citations.
The beginning of the fourteenth century witnessed the growth of a new
Italian prose. Of this second stage, the masterpieces are Villani's
Chronicle, Dante's <i>Vita Nuova</i>, the <i>Fioretti di S. Francesco</i>, the
<i>Leggende dei Santi Padri</i> of Domenico Cavalca, and Jacopo Passavanti's
<i>Specchio della vera Penitenza</i>.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> These writers have no lack of
individuality. Their mind moves in their style, and gives a personal
complexion to their utterance. The chief charm of their manner, so far
as it is common to characters so diverse, is its grave and childlike
spontaneity. For vividness of description, for natural simplicity of
phrase, and for that amiable garrulity which rounds a picture by
innumerable details and unconscious touches of graphic force, not one of
the books of this period surpasses the <i>Fioretti</i>. Nor are the
<i>Leggende</i> of Cavalca less admirable. Modern, especially Northern,
students may discover too much suavity and unction in the writer's
tone&#8212;a superfluity of sweetness which fatigues, a caressing tenderness
that clogs. After reading a few pages, we lay the book down, and wonder
whether it could really have been a grown man, and not a cherub flown
from Fra Angelico's Paradise, who composed it. This infantine note
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">-132-</a></span>longs to the cloister and the pulpit. It matches the simple credulity
of the narrator, and well befits the miracles he loves to record. We
seem to hear a good old monk gossiping to a party of rosy-cheeked
novices, like those whom Sodoma painted in his frescoes of S. Benedict
at Monte Oliveto. It need hardly be observed that neither in Villani's
nor in Dante's prose do we find the same puerility. But all the
<i>trecentisti</i> have a common character of limpidity, simplicity, and
unaffected grace.</p>

<p>The difficulties under which even the best Italian authors labor while
using their own language, incline them to an exaggerated admiration for
these pearls of the <i>trecento</i>. They look back with envy to an age when
men could write exactly as they thought and felt and spoke, without the
tyranny of the <i>Vocabolario</i> or the fear of an Academy before their
eyes. We, with whom the literary has always closely followed the spoken
language, and who have, practically speaking, no dialects, while we
recognize the purity of that incomparably transparent manner, cannot
comprehend that it should be held up for imitation in the present age.
To paint like Giotto would be easier than to write like Passavanti. The
conditions of life and the modes of thought are so altered that the
style of the <i>trecento</i> will not lend itself to modern requirements.</p>

<p>Among the prosaists of the fourteenth century&#8212;Cavalca, Villani, the
author of the <i>Fioretti</i>, and Passavanti&#8212;Boccaccio meets us with a
sudden surprise. They aimed at finding the readiest and most appropriate
words to convey their meaning in the simplest, most effective manner.
Without artistic purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">-133-</a></span> without premeditation, without side-glances
at the classics, they wrote straightforward from their heart. There is
little composition or connection in their work, no molding of paragraphs
or rounding of phrases, no oratorical development, no gradation of tone.
Boccaccio, on the contrary, sought to give the fullness and sonority of
Latin to the periods of Italian prose. He had the Ciceronian cadence and
the labyrinthine sentences of Livy in view. By art of style he was bent
on rendering the vulgar language a fit vehicle for learning, rhetoric,
and history. In order to make it clear what sorts of changes he
introduced, it will be necessary to compare his prose with that of his
contemporaries. Dante used the following words to describe his first
meeting with Beatrice<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>:</p>

Beatrice, i quali non sapeano che si chiamare. Ella era gi&#224; in

spins the following cocoon of verbiage:<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Dante's style is analytic and direct. The sentences follow each other
naturally; and though the language is stiff, from scrupulous precision,
and in one place intentionally obscure, it is free from affectation.
Boccaccio aims at a synthetic presentation of all he means to say; and
he calls nothing by its right name, if he can devise a periphrasis. The
breathless period pants its labored clauses out, and dwindles to a lame
conclusion. The <i>Filocopo</i> was, however, an immature production. In
order to do its author justice, and at the same time to compare his
style with a graceful piece of fourteenth-century composition, I will
select a passage from the <i>Fioretti di S. Francesco</i>, and place it
beside one taken from the first novel of the Decameron. This is the
episode of S. Anthony preaching to the fishes<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>:</p>

<p>These examples will suffice to show how Boccaccio distinguished himself
from the <i>trecentisti</i> in general. When his style attained perfection in
the Decameron, it had lost the pedantry of his first manner, and
combined the brevity of the best contemporary writers with rhetorical
smoothness and intricacy. The artful structure of the period, and the
cadences of what afterwards came to be known as &quot;numerous prose,&quot; were
carried to perfection. Still, though he was the earliest writer of a
scientific style, Boccaccio failed to exercise a paramount influence
over the language until the age of the Academies.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The writers of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">-136-</a></span> fifteenth century, partly no doubt because these were chiefly men
of the people, appear to have developed their manner out of the material
of the <i>trecento</i> in general, modified by contemporary usage. This is
manifest in the <i>Reali di Francia</i>, a work of considerable stylistic
power, which cannot probably be dated earlier than the middle of the
fifteenth century. The novelist Masuccio modeled his diction, so far as
he was able, on the type of the Decameron, and Alberti owed much to the
study of such works as the <i>Fiammetta</i>. Yet, speaking broadly, neither
the excellences nor the defects of Boccaccio found devoted imitators
until the epoch when the nation at large turned their attention to the
formation of a common Italian style. It was then, in the days of Bembo
and Sperone, that Boccaccio took rank with Petrarch as an infallible
authority on points of language. The homage rendered at that period to
the Decameron decided the destinies of Italian prose, and has since been
deplored by critics who believe Boccaccio to have established a false
standard of taste.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> This is a question which must be left to the
Italians to decide. One thing, however, is clear; that a nation schooled
by humanistic studies of a Latin type, divided by their dialects, and
removed by the advance of culture beyond the influences of the purer
<i>trecentisti</i>, found in the rhetorical diction of the Decameron a common
model better suited to their taste and capacity than the simple style of
the Villani could have furnished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">-137-</a></span></p>

<p>Boccaccio died in 1375, seventeen months after the death at Arqu&#224; of his
master, Petrarch. The painter Andrea Orcagna died about the same period.
With these three great artists the genius of medieval Florence sank to
sleep. A temporary torpor fell upon the people, who during the next half
century produced nothing of marked originality in literature and art.
The Middle Age had passed away. The Renaissance was still in
preparation. When Boccaccio breathed his last, men felt that the elder
sources of inspiration had failed, and that no more could be expected
from the spirit of the previous centuries. Heaven and hell, the
sanctuaries of the soul, the garden of this earth, had been traversed.
The tentative essays and scattered preludings, the dreams and visions,
the preparatory efforts of all previous modern literatures, had been
completed, harmonized and presented to the world in the master-works of
Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. What remained but to make a new start?
This step forward or aside was now to be taken in the Classical Revival.
Well might Sacchetti exclaim in that <i>canzone</i><a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> which is at once

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">The</span> two preceding chapters will have made it clear that the Church,
Chivalry, and the Nation contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">-140-</a></span> their several quotas to the growth
of Italian literature.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The ecclesiastical or religious element, so
triumphantly expressed in the Divine Comedy, was not peculiar to the
Italians. They held it in common with the whole of Christendom; and
though the fabric of the Roman Church took form in Italy, though the
race gave S. Francis, S. Thomas, and S. Bonaventura to the militia of
the medieval faith, still the Italians as a nation were not specifically
religious. Piety, which is quite a different thing from ecclesiastical
organization, was never the truest and sincerest accent of their genius.
Had it been so, the history of Latin Christianity would have followed
another course, and the schism of the sixteenth century might have been
avoided.</p>

<p>The chivalrous element they shared, at a considerable disadvantage, with
the rest of feudal Europe. Chivalry was not indigenous to Italian soil,
nor did it ever flourish there. The literature which it produced in
France, became Italian only when the Guidi and Dante gave it
philosophical significance. Petrarch, who represents this motive, as
Dante represents the ecclesiastical, generalized Proven&#231;al poetry. His
<i>Canzoniere</i> cannot be styled a masterpiece of chivalrous art. Its
spirit is modern and human in a wider and more comprehensive sense.</p>

<p>To characterize the national strain in this complex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">-141-</a></span> pedigree of culture
is no easy task&#8212;chiefly because it manifested itself under two
apparently antagonistic forms; first in the recovery of the classics by
the scholars of the fifteenth century; secondly in the portraiture of
Italian character and temperament by writers of romance and fiction. The
divergence of these two main currents of literary energy upon the close
of the middle ages, and their junction in the prime of the Renaissance,
are the topics of my present volume.</p>

<p>We have seen how tenaciously the Italians clung to memories of ancient
Rome, and how their history deprived them of that epical material which
started modern literature among the northern races. While the vulgar
language was being formed from the dialects into which rustic Latin had
divided, a new nationality grew into shape by an analogous process out
of the remnants of the old Italic population, fused with recent
immigrants. Absorbing Greek blood in the south and Teutonic in the
north, this composite race maintained the ascendancy of the Romanized
people, in obedience to laws whereby the prevalent and indigenous strain
outlives and assimilates ingredients from without. Owing to a variety of
causes, among which must be reckoned geographical isolation and
imperfect Lombard occupation, the purest Italic stock survived upon the
Tuscan plains and highlands, between the Tyrrhene Sea and the Apennines,
and where the Arno and the Tiber start together from the mountains of
Arezzo. This region was the cradle of the new Italian language, the
stronghold of the new Italian nation. Its center, political, commercial
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">-142-</a></span> intellectual, was Florence, which gave birth to the three great
poets of the fourteenth century. Though Florence developed her
institutions later than the Lombard communes, she maintained a civic
independence longer than any State but Venice; and her <i>popolo</i> may be
regarded as the type of the popular Italian element. Here the genius of
Italy became conscious of itself, and here the people found a spokesman
in Boccaccio. Abandoning ecclesiastical and feudal traditions, Boccaccio
concentrated his force upon the delineation of his fellow-countrymen as
he had learned to know them. The Italians of the new age start into
distinctness in his work, with the specific qualities they were destined
to maintain and to mature during the next two centuries. Thus Boccaccio
fully represents one factor of what I have called the national element.
At the same time, he occupies a hardly less important place in relation
to the other or the humanistic factor. Like his master Petrarch, he
pronounced with ardor and decision for that scholarship which restored
the link between the present and the past of the Italian race.
Independently of their achievements in modern literature, we have to
regard the humanistic efforts of these two great writers as a sign that
the national element had asserted itself in antagonism to the Church and
chivalry.</p>

<p>The recovery of the classics was, in truth, the decisive fact in Italian
evolution. Having attained full consciousness in the Florence of Dante's
age, the people set forth in search of their spiritual patrimony. They
found it in the libraries. They became pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">-143-</a></span>sessed of it through the
labors of the scholars. Italian literature during the first three
quarters of the fifteenth century merged, so far as polite society was
concerned, in Humanism, the history of which has already been presented
to the reader in the second volume of this work.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> For a hundred
years, from the publication of the Decameron in 1373 to the publication
of Poliziano's <i>Stanze</i>, the genius of Italy was engaged in an
exploratory pilgrimage, the ultimate end of which was the restoration of
the national inheritance in ancient Rome. This process of renascent
classicism, which was tantamount to ranascent nationality, retarded the
growth of the vulgar literature. Yet it was imperatively demanded not
only by the needs of Europe at large, but more particularly and urgently
by the Italians themselves, who, unlike the other modern races, had no
starting-point but ancient Rome. The immediate result of the humanistic
movement was the separation of the national element into two sections,
learned and popular, Latin and Italian. The common people, who had
repeated Dante's <i>Canzoni</i>, and whose life Boccaccio had portrayed in
the Decameron, were now divided from the rising class of scholars and
professors. Cultivated persons of all ranks despised Italian, and spent
their time in studies beyond the reach of the laity. Like some mountain
rivers after emerging from the highlands of their origin, the vernacular
literature passed as it were for a season underground, and lost itself
in unexplored ravines. Absorbed into the masses of the people, it
continued an obscure but by no means insignificant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">-144-</a></span> course, whence it
was destined to reappear at the right moment, when the several
constituents of the nation had attained the sense of intellectual unity.
This sense of unity was the product of the classical revival; for the
activity of the wandering professors and the fanatical enthusiasm for
the ancients were needed to create a common consciousness, a common
standard of taste and intelligence in the peninsula. It must in this
connection be remembered that the vernacular literature of the
fourteenth century, though it afterwards became the glory of Italy as a
whole, was originally Florentine. The medium prepared by the scholars
was demanded in order that the Tuscan classics should be accepted by the
nation as their own. Toward the close of the fifteenth century, a fusion
between the humanistic and the vulgar literatures was made; and this is
the renascence of Italian&#8212;no longer Tuscan, but participated by the
race at large. The poetry of the people then received a form refined by
classic learning; and the two sections of what I have called the
national element, joined to produce the genuine Italian culture of the
golden age.</p>

<p>It is necessary, for the sake of clearness, to insist upon this point,
which forms the main motive of my present theme. After the death of
Boccaccio the history of Italian literature is the history of that
national element which distinguished itself from the ecclesiastical and
the chivalrous, and at last in the Decameron asserted its superiority
over both. But the stream of intellectual energy bifurcates. During the
fifteenth century, the Latin instincts of the new Italic people found
vigorous expansion in the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">-145-</a></span>istic movement, while the vernacular
literature carried on a fitful and obscure, but potent, growth among the
proletariate. At the end of that century, both currents, the learned and
the popular, the classical and the modern, reunited on a broader plane.
The nation, educated by scholarship and brought to a sense of its
identity, resumed the vulgar tongue; and what had hitherto been Tuscan,
now became Italian. In this renascence neither the religious nor the
feudal principle regained firm hold upon the race. Their influence is
still discernible, however, in the lyrics of the Petrarchisti and the
epics of Orlando; for nothing which has once been absorbed into a
people's thought is wholly lost. How they were transmuted by the action
of the genuine Italic genius, triumphant now upon all quarters of the
field, will appear in the sequel of these volumes; while it remains for
another work to show in what way, under the influences of the
Counter-Reformation, both the ecclesiastical and the chivalrous elements
reasserted themselves for a brief moment in Tasso. Still even in Tasso
we recognize the Italian courtier rather than the knight or the ascetic.
For the rest, it is clear that the spirit of Boccaccio&#8212;that is, the
spirit of the Florentine people&#8212;refined by humanistic discipline and
glorified by the reawakening of Italy to a sense of intellectual unity,
determined the character of literature during its most brilliant
period.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">-146-</a></span></p>

<p>Many peculiarities of the Renaissance in Italy, and of the Renaissance
in general, as communicated through Italians to Europe, can be explained
by this emergence of the national Italic temperament. Political and
positive; keenly sensitive to natural beauty, and gifted with a quick
artistic faculty; neither persistently religious nor profoundly
speculative; inclined to skepticism, but accepting the existing order
with sarcastic acquiescence; ironical and humorous rather than
satirical; sensuous in feeling, realistic in art, rhetorical in
literature; abhorring mysticism and ill-fashioned for romantic
exaltation; worldly, with a broad and genial toleration; refined in
taste and social conduct, but violent in the indulgence of personal
proclivities; born old in contrast with the youth of the Teutonic races;
educated by long experience to expect a morrow differing in no
essentials from to-day or yesterday; demanding, therefore, from the
moment all that it can yield of satisfaction to the passions&#8212;the
Italians, thus constituted, in their vigorous reaction against the
middle ages, secularized the Papacy, absorbed the Paganism of the
classics, substituted an &#230;sthetic for an ethical ideal, democratized
society, and opened new horizons for pioneering energy in all the fields
of knowledge. The growth of their intelligence was precocious and
fore-doomed to a sudden check; nor was it to be expected that their
solutions of the deepest problems should satisfy races of a different
fiber and a posterity educated on the scientific methods of
investi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">-147-</a></span>gation. Unexpected factors were added to the general calculation
by the German Reformation and the political struggles which preceded the
French Revolution. Yet the influence of this Italian temperament, in
forming and preparing the necessary intellectual medium in modern
Europe, can hardly be exaggerated.</p>

<p>When the Italian genius manifested itself in art, in letters and in
scholarship, national unity was already an impossibility.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The race
had been broken up into republics and tyrannies. Their political forces
were centrifugal rather than centripetal. The first half of the
fifteenth century was the period when their division into five great
powers, held together by the frail bond of diplomacy, had been
accomplished, and when Italy was further distracted by the ambition of
unprincipled <i>condottieri</i>. Under these conditions of dismemberment, the
Renaissance came to perfection, and the ideal unity of the Italians was
achieved. The space of forty years' tranquillity and equilibrium, which
preceded Charles VIII.'s invasion, marked an epoch of recombination and
consolidation, when the two currents of national energy, learned and
popular, met to form the culture of the golden age. After being Tuscan
and neo-Latin, the literature which expressed the nation now became
Italian. Such is the importance of the <i>Quattrocento</i> in Italian
history&#8212;long denied, late recognized, but now at length acknowledged as
necessary and decisive for both Italy and Europe.</p>

<p>In the present chapter I propose to follow the transition from the
middle ages effected by writers who, though they used the mother tongue,
take rank among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">-148-</a></span> cultivated authors. The two succeeding chapters will be
devoted to the more obscure branches of vernacular literature which
flourished among the people.</p>

<p>Franco Sacchetti, who uttered the funeral dirge of the fourteenth
century, was also the last considerable writer of that age.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Born
about the year 1335, of one of the old noble families of Florence, he
lived until the end of the century, employed in various public duties
and assiduous in his pursuit of letters.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> He was a friend of
Boccaccio, and felt the highest admiration not only for his novels but
also for his learning, though he tells us in the preface to his own
three hundred tales that he was himself a man of slender
erudition&#8212;<i>uomo discolo e grosso</i>.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> From this preface we also learn
that enthusiasm for the Decameron prompted him to write a set of novels
on his own account.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Though Sacchetti loved and worshiped Boccaccio,
he did not imitate his style. The <i>Novelle</i> are composed in the purest
vernacular, without literary artifice or rhetorical ornament. They boast
no framework of fiction, like that which lends the setting of romance to
the Decameron; nor do they pretend to be more than short anecdotes with
here and there a word of moralizing from the author. Yet the student of
Italian, eager to know what speech was current in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">-149-</a></span>the streets of
Florence during the last half of that century, will value Sacchetti's
idiomatic language even more highly than Boccaccio's artful periods. He
tells us what the people thought and felt, in phrases borrowed from
their common talk. The majority of the novels treat of Florentine life,
while some of them bring illustrious Florentines&#8212;Dante and Giotto and
Guido Cavalcanti&#8212;on the scene. Sacchetti's preface vouches for the
truth of his stories; but, whether they be strictly accurate or not, we
need not doubt their fidelity to contemporary customs, domestic manners,
and daily conversation. Sacchetti inspires a certain confidence, a
certain feeling of friendliness. And yet what a world is revealed in his
<i>Novelle</i>&#8212;a world without tenderness, pathos, high principle, passion,
or enthusiasm&#8212;men and women delighting in coarse humor, in practical
jokes of inconceivable vulgarity, in language of undisguised grossness,
in cruelty, fraud, violence, incontinence! The point is almost always
some clever trick, a <i>burla</i> or a <i>beffa</i>, or a piece of subtly-planned
retaliation. Knaves and fools are the chief actors in this comic
theater; and among the former we find many friars, among the latter many
husbands. To accept the <i>Novelle</i> as adequate in every detail to the
facts of Florentine society, would be uncritical. They must chiefly be
used for showing what passed for fun among the burghers, and what seemed
fit and decent topics for discussion. Studied from that point of view,
and also for the abundant light they throw on customs and fashions,
Sacchetti's tales are highly valuable. The <i>bourgeoisie</i> of Florence
lives again in their animated pages. We have in them a literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">-150-</a></span>
written to amuse, if not precisely to represent, a civic society closely
packed within a narrow area, witty and pleasure-loving, acutely
sensitive to the ridiculous, with strongly-denned tastes and a decided
preference for pungent flavors. One distinctive Florentine quality
emerges with great clearness. That is a malicious and jibing humor&#8212;the
malice Dante took with him to the <i>Inferno</i>; the malice expressed by Il
Lasca and Firenzuola, epitomized in Florentine nicknames, and condensed
in Rabelaisian anecdotes which have become classical. It reaches its
climax in the cruel but laughter-moving jest played by Brunelleschi on
the unfortunate cabinet-maker, which has been transmitted to us in the
novel of <i>Il Grasso, Legnaiuolo</i>.</p>

<p>Somewhat later than Sacchetti's <i>Novelle</i>, appeared another collection
of more or less veracious anecdotes, compiled by a certain Ser
Giovanni.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> He called it <i>Il Pecorone</i>, which may be interpreted &quot;The
Simpleton:&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing is known about Ser Giovanni, except what he tells us in the
Sonnet just quoted. From it we learn that he began his <i>Novelle</i> in the
year 1378&#8212;the year of the Ciompi Revolution at Florence. As a
frame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">-151-</a></span>work for his stories, he devised a frigid romance which may be
briefly told. Sister Saturnina, the prioress of a convent at Forl&#236;, was
so wise and beautiful that her fame reached Florence, where a handsome
and learned youth, named Auretto, fell in love with her by hearsay. He
took orders, journeyed across the Apennines, and contrived to be
appointed chaplain to Saturnina's nuns. In due course of time she
discreetly returned his affection, and, managing their affairs with
prudence and decorum, they met for private converse and mutual solace in
a parlor of the convent. Here they whiled away the hours by telling
stories&#8212;entertaining, instructive, or romantic. The collection is
divided into twenty-five days; and since each lover tells a tale, there
are fifty <i>Novelle</i>, interspersed with songs after the fashion of
Boccaccio. In the style, no less than in the method of the book, Ser
Giovanni shows himself a closer follower of the Decameron than
Sacchetti. His novels have a wide range of incidents, embracing tragic
and pathetic motives no less than what is humorous. They are treated
rhetorically, and, instead of being simple anecdotes, aim at the varied
movement of a drama. The language, too, is literary, and less idiomatic
than Sacchetti's. Antiquarians will find in some of these discourses an
interest separate from what is common to works of fiction. They
represent how history was communicated to the people of that day.
Saturnina, for example, relates the myth of Troy and the foundation of
Fiesole, which, as Dante tells us, the Tuscan mothers of Cacciaguida's
age sang to their children. The lives of the Countess Matilda and
Frederick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">-152-</a></span> Barbarossa, the antiquity and wealth of the Tuscan cities,
the tragedy of Corso Donati, Giano della Bella's exile, the Angevine
Conquest of Sicily, the origin of Guelfs and Ghibellines in Italy,
Attila's apocryphal siege of Florence, supply materials for narratives
in which the true type of the <i>Novella</i> disappears. Yet Ser Giovanni
mingles more amusing stories with these lectures;<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and the
historical dissertations are managed with such grace, with so golden a
simplicity of style, that they are readable. Of a truth it is comic to
think of the enamored monk and nun meeting in the solitude of their
parlor to exchange opinions upon Italian history. Though he had the good
qualities of a <i>trecentisto</i> prosaist, Ser Giovanni was in this respect
but a poor artist.</p>

<p>Both Sacchetti and Ser Giovanni were poets of no mean ability. As in his
prose, so also in his <i>Canzoni a Ballo</i>, the author of the <i>Pecorone</i>
followed Boccaccio, without, however, attaining to that glow and
sensuous abandonment which renders the lyrics no less enchanting than
the narratives of the Decameron. His style is smooth and fluent,
suggesting literary culture rather than spontaneous inspiration.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
Yet it is always lucid. Through the transparent language we see straight
into the hearts of lovers as the novelist of Florence understood them.
Written for the most part in the seven-lined stanza with recurring
couplet, which Guido <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">-153-</a></span>Cavalcanti first made fashionable, these <i>Ballate</i>
give lyrical expression to a great variety of tender situations. The
emotion of first love, the pains and pleasures of a growing passion, the
anguish of betrayal, regrets, quarrels, reconciliations, are
successively treated. In short, Ser Giovanni versified and set to music
all the principal motives upon which the <i>Novella</i> of feeling turned,
and formed an <i>ars amandi</i> adapted to the use of the people. In this
sense his poems seem to have been accepted, for we find MSS. of the
<i>Ballate</i> detached from the prose of <i>Il Pecorone</i>.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Among the most
striking may be mentioned the canzonet <i>Tradita sono</i>, which
retrospectively describes the joy of a girl in her first love; another
on the fashions of Florentine ladies, <i>Quante leggiadre</i>; and the
lamentation of a woman whose lover has abandoned her, and who sees no
prospect but the cloister&#8212;<i>Oi me lassa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Ser Giovanni's lyrics are echoes of the city, where maidens danced their
rounds upon the piazza in May evenings, and young men courted the beauty
of the hour with songs and visits to her chamber:</p>

<p>Franco Sacchetti carries us to somewhat different scenes. The best of
his madrigals and canzonets describe the pleasures of country life. They
are not genuinely rustic; nor do they, in Theocritean fashion, attempt
to render the beauty of the country from the peasant's point of view. On
the contrary, they owe their fascination to the contrast between the
simplicity of the villa and the unrest of the town, where:</p>

<p class="center">Mai vi si dice e di ben far vi &#232; caro.</p>

<p>They are written for and by the <i>bourgeois</i> who has escaped from shops
and squares and gossiping street-corners. The keynote of this poetry,
which has always something of the French <i>&#233;cole buissonni&#232;re</i> in its
fresh unalloyed enjoyment, is struck in a song describing the return of
Spring<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>:</p>

<p>This note of gayety and pure enjoyment is sustained throughout his
lyrics. In one <i>Ballata</i> he describes a country girl, caught by thorns,
and unable to avoid her admirer's glance.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Another gives a pretty
picture of a maiden with a wreath of olive-leaves and silver.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> A
third is a little idyll of two girls talking to their lambs, and
followed by an envious old woman.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> A fourth is a biting satire on
old women&#8212;<i>Di diavol vecchia femmina ha natura</i>.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> A fifth is that
incomparably graceful canzonet, <i>O vaghe montanine pasturelle</i>, the
popularity of which is proved by the fact that it was orally transmitted
for many generations, and attributed in after days to both Lorenzo de'
Medici and Angelo Poliziano.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Indeed, it may be said in passing that
Poliziano owed much to Sacchetti. This can be seen by comparing
Sacchetti's <i>Ballata</i> on the Gentle Heart, and his pastoral of the
Thorn-tree with the later poet's lyrics.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The unexpressed contrast between the cautious town-life of the burgher
poet and his license in the villa, to which I have already called
attention, determines the character of many minor lyrics by
Sachetti.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> We comprehend the spirit of these curious poems, at once
popular and fashionable, when we <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">-156-</a></span>compare them with medieval French
<i>Pastourelles</i>, or with similar compositions by wandering Latin
students. In the <i>Carmina Burana</i> may be found several little poems,
describing the fugitive loves of truant scholars with rustic girls,
which prove that, long before Sacchetti's age, the town had sought
spring-solace in the country.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Men are too apt to fancy that what
they consider the refinements of passion and fashion (the finer edge,
for example, put upon desire by altering its object from the known and
trivial to the untried and exceptional, from venal beauties in the city
to shepherd maidens on the village-green) are inventions of their own
times. Yet it was precisely a refinement of this sort which gave
peculiar flavor to Sacchetti's songs in the fourteenth century, and
which made them sought after. They had great vogue in Italy, enjoying
the privilege of popularity among the working classes, and helping to
diffuse that sort of pastoral part-song which we still know as
Madrigal.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Sacchetti was himself a good musician; many of his songs
were set to music by himself, and others by his friends. This gives a
pleasant old-world homeliness to the Latin titles inscribed beneath the
rubrics&#8212;<i>Franciscus de Organis sonum dedit</i>; <i>Intonatum per Francum
Sacchetti</i>; <i>Francus sonum dedit</i>; and so forth.</p>

<p>The Ballads and Madrigals of Niccol&#242; Soldanieri should be mentioned in
connection with Sacchetti; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">-157-</a></span>though they do not detach themselves in any
marked way from the style of love poetry practiced at the close of the
fourteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The case is different with Alesso Donati's
lyrics. In them we are struck by a new gust of coarse and powerful
realism, which has no parallel among the elder poets except in the
savage sonnets of Cecco Angiolieri. Vividly natural situations are here
detached from daily life and delineated with intensity of passion,
vehement sincerity. Sacchetti's gentleness and genial humor have
disappeared. In their place we find a dramatic energy and a truth of
language that are almost terrible. Each of the little scenes, which I
propose to quote in illustration of these remarks, might be compared to
etchings bitten with aquafortis into copper. Here, for example, is a
nun, who has resolved to throw aside her veil and follow her lover in a
page's dress<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>:</p>

<p>To translate these madrigals would be both difficult and undesirable. It
is enough to have printed the original texts. They prove that
aristocratic versifiers at this period were adopting the style of the
people, and adding the pungency of brief poetic treatment to episodes
suggested by <i>novelle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>While dealing with the Novelle and the semi-popular literature of this
transition period, I have hitherto neglected those numerous minor poets
who continued the traditions of the earlier <i>trecento</i>.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> There are
two main reasons for this preference. In the first place, the <i>novelle</i>
was destined to play a most important part in the history of the
Renaissance, imposing its own laws of composition upon species so remote
as the religious drama and romantic epic. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">-159-</a></span>In the second place, the
dance-songs, canzonets and madrigals of Sacchetti's epoch lived upon the
lips of the common folk, who during the fifteenth century carried
Italian literature onward through a subterranean channel.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> When
vernacular poetry reappeared into the light of erudition and the Courts,
the influences of that popular style, which drew its origin from
Boccaccio and Sacchetti rather than from Dante or the Trovatori,
determined the manner of Lorenzo de' Medici and Poliziano. Meanwhile the
learned poems of the latest <i>trecentisti</i> were forgotten with the lumber
of the middle ages. For the special purpose, therefore, of this volume,
which only regards the earlier stages of Italian literature in so far as
they preceded and conditioned the Renaissance, it was necessary to give
the post of honor to Boccaccio's followers. Some mention should,
however, here be made of those contemporaries and imitators of Petrarch,
in whom the traditions of the fourteenth century expired. It is not
needful to pass in review the many versifiers who treated the old themes
of chivalrous love with meritorious conventional facility. The true life
of the Italians was not here; and the phase of literature which the
Sicilian School inaugurated, survived already as an anachronism. The
case is different with such poetry as dealt immediately with
contemporary politics. In the declamatory compositions of this age, we
hear the echoes of the Guelf and Ghibelline wars. The force of that
great struggle was already spent; but the partisans of either faction,
passion enough sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">-160-</a></span>vived to furnish genuine inspiration. Fazio degli
Uberti's <i>sermintese</i> on the cities of Italy, for example, was written
in the bitter spirit of an exiled Ghibelline.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> His ode to Charles

<p>The Italian Ghibellines had, indeed, good reason to complain that German
gluttons, C&#230;sars in naught but name, who only thought of making money by
their sale of fiefs and honors, had changed the eagle of the Empire into
an obscene night-flying bird of prey. The same spirit is breathed in

<p>This is the last echo of the <i>De Monarchi&#226;</i>. The great imperial idea, so
destructive to Italian confederation, so dazzling to patriots of Dante's
fiber, expires amid the wailings of minstrels who cry for the
impossible, and haunt the Courts of petty Lombard princes.</p>

<p>In another set of <i>Canzoni</i> we listen to Guelf and Ghibelline
recriminations, rising from the burghs of Tuscany. The hero of these
poems is Gian Galeazzo Visconti, rightly recognized by the Guelfs of
Florence as a venomous and selfish tyrant, foolishly belauded by the
Ghibellines of Siena as the vindicator of imperial principles. The
Emperors have abandoned Italy; the Popes are at Avignon. The factions
which their quarrels generated, agitate their people still, but on a
narrower basis. Sacchetti slings invectives against the <i>maladetta
serpe, aspro tiranno con amaro fele</i>, who shall be throttled by the
Church and Florence, leagued to crush the Lombard despots.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Saviozzo

barred only by Florence, when the Plague cut short his career in 1402.

<p>The Ghibelline poets, whether they dreamed like Fazio of Roman Empire,
or flattered the Visconti with a crown to be won by triumph over the
detested Guelfs, made play with Dante's memory. Some of the most

Considerable interest attaches to these political compositions for the
light they throw on party feeling at the close of the heroic age of

<p>Yet neither in the confused idealism of the Ghibellines nor in the
honest independence of the Guelfs lay the true principle of national
progress. Sinking gradually and inevitably beneath the sway of despots,
the Italians in the fifteenth century were destined to become a nation
of scholars, artists, <i>litterati</i>. The age of Dante, the uncompromising
aristocrat, was over. The age of Boccaccio, the easy-going <i>bourgeois</i>,
had begun. The future glories of Italy were to be won in the field of
culture; and all the hortatory lyrics I have mentioned, exerted but
little influence over the development of a spirit which was growing
quietly within the precincts of the people. The Italian people at this
epoch cared far less for the worn-out factions of the Guelfs and
Ghibellines than for home-comforts and tranquillity in burgher
occupations. The keener intellects of the fifteenth century were already
so absorbingly occupied with art and classical studies that there was no
room left in them for politics of the old revolutionary type. Meanwhile
the new intrigues of Cabinets and Courts were left to a class of
humanistic diplomatists, created by the conditions of despotic
government. Scarcely less ineffectual were the moral verses of
Bambagiuoli and Cavalca, or the Petrarchistic imitations of Marchionne
Torrigiani, Federigo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">-165-</a></span> d'Arezzo, Coluccio Salutati, Roberto di
Battifolle, and Bonaccorso da Montemagno.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The former belonged to a
phase of medieval culture which was waning. The elegant but lifeless
Petrarchistic school dragged through the fifteenth century, culminating
in the <i>Canzoniere</i> of Giusto de' Conti, a Roman, which was called <i>La
bella mano</i>. The revival of their mannerism, with a fixed artistic
motive, by Bembo and the purists of the sixteenth century, will form
part of my later history of Renaissance literature.</p>

<p>One note is unmistakable in all the poetry of these last <i>trecentisti</i>.
It is a note of profound discouragement, mistrust, and disappointment.
We have already heard it sounded by Sacchetti in his lament for
Boccaccio. Boccaccio had raised it himself in two noble sonnets&#8212;<i>Apizio
legge</i> and <i>Fuggit'&#232; ogni virt&#249;</i>.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> It takes the shrillness of a
threnody in Tedaldi's <i>Il mondo vile</i> and in Manfredi di Boccaccio's
<i>Amico il mondo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The poets of that age were dimly conscious that a
new era had opened for their country&#8212;an era of money-getting,
despotism, and domestic ease. They saw the people used to servitude and
sunk in common pleasures&#8212;dead to the high aims and imaginative
aspirations of the past. The turbulence of the heroic age was gone. The
men of the present were all <i>Vigliacci</i>. And as yet both art and
learning were but in their cradle. It was impossible upon the opening of
the fifteenth century, in that crepuscular interval between two periods
of splendor, to know what glories for Italy and for the world at large
would <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">-166-</a></span>be produced by Giotto's mighty lineage and Petrarch's progeny of
scholars. We who possess in history the vision of that future can be
content to wait through a transition century. The men of the moment not
unnaturally expressed the querulousness of Italy, distracted by her
struggles of the past and sinking into somnolence. Cosimo de' Medici,
the molder of Renaissance Florence, was already born in 1389; and men of
Cosimo's stamp were no heroes for poets who had felt the passions that
moved Dante.</p>

<p>The Divine Comedy found fewer imitators than the <i>Canzoniere</i>; for who
could bend the bow of Ulysses? Yet some poets of the transition were
hardy enough to attempt the Dantesque meter, and to pretend in a prosaic
age that they had shared the vision of the prophets. Among these should
be mentioned Fazio degli Uberti, a scion of Farinata's noble house, who
lived and traveled much in exile.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Taking Solinus, the antique
geographer, for his guide, Fazio produced a topographical poem called
the <i>Dicta Mundi</i> or <i>Dittamondo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>From the prosaic matter of this poem, which resembles a very primitive
Mappamondo, illustrated with interludes of history and excursions into
mythological zo&#246;logy, based upon the text of Pliny, and not unworthy of
Mandeville, two episodes emerge and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">-167-</a></span>arrest attention. One is the
description of Rome&#8212;a somber lady in torn raiment, who tells the
history of her eventful past, describes her triumphs and her empire, and
points to the ruins on her seven crowned hills to show how beautiful she
was in youth<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>:</p>

<p>Such value as the <i>Dittamondo</i> may still retain for students, it owes
partly to the author's enthusiasm for ancient Rome, and partly to the
sympathy with nature he had acquired during his wandering as an exile
over the sacred soil of Italy.</p>

<p>Another poem of Dantesque derivation was the <i>Quadriregio</i> of Federigo
Frezzi, Bishop of Foligno.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">-169-</a></span>It is an allegorical account of human
life; and the four regions, which give their name to the book, are the
realms of Love, Satan, Vice and Virtue.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> To cast the moralizations
of the middle ages in a form imitated from Dante, after Dante had
already condensed the ethics and politics, the theology and science of
his century in the Divine Comedy, was little less than a hopeless task.
Nor need a word be spent upon the <i>Quadriregio</i>, except by way of
illustrating the peculiar conditions of the poetic art, here upon the
border-land between the middle age and the Renaissance. Federigo Frezzi
was intent on depicting the victories of virtue over vice, and on
explaining the advantage offered to the Christian by grace. Yet he chose
a mythological framework for his doctrine. Cupid, Venus and Minerva are
confused with Satan, Enoch and Elijah. Instead of Eden there is the
golden age. Nymphs of Diana, Juno, and the like, are used as emblems.
Pallas discourses about Christ, and expounds the Christian system of
redemption. The earthly Paradise contains Helicon, with all the antique
poets. Jupiter is contrasted with Satan. It is the same blending of
antique with Christian motives which we note in the Divine Comedy; but
the tact of the great artist is absent, and the fusion becomes
grotesque. After reading through the poem we lay it down with the same
feeling as that produced in us by studying some pulpit of the Pisan
School, where a Gothic Devil, all horns and hoofs and grinning jaws,
squats cheek by jowl with a Madonna copied from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">-170-</a></span> Roman tomb. The

<p>Last upon the list of Dantesque imitators stands Matteo Palmieri, a
learned Florentine, who composed his <i>Citt&#224; di Vita</i> in the middle of
the fifteenth century. This poem won for its author from Marsilio Ficino
the title of <i>Poeta Theologicus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Its chief interest at the present
time is that the theology expressed in it brought suspicion of heresy on
Palmieri. He held Origen's opinion that the souls of men were rebel
angels. How a doctrine of this kind could be rendered in painting is not
clear. Yet Giorgio Vasari tells us that a picture executed for Matteo
Palmieri by Sandro Botticelli, which represented the Assumption of the
Virgin into the celestial hierarchy&#8212;Powers, Princedoms, Thrones and
Dominations ranged around her in concentric circles&#8212;fell under the
charge of heterodoxy. The altar in S. Pietro Maggiore where it was
placed had to be interdicted, and the picture <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">-172-</a></span>veiled from sight.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
The story forms a curious link between this last scion of medieval
literature and the painting of the Renaissance. After Palmieri the meter
of the Divine Comedy was chiefly used for satire and burlesque. Lorenzo
de' Medici adapted its grave rhythms to parody in <i>I Beoni</i>. Berni used
it for the Capitoli of the <i>Pesche</i> and the <i>Peste</i>. At Florence it
became the recognized meter for obscene and frivolous compositions,
which delighted the Academicians of the sixteenth century. The people,
meanwhile, continued to employ it in <i>Lamenti</i>, historical compositions,
and personal Capitoli.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Thus Cellini wrote his poem called <i>I
Carceri</i> in <i>terza rima</i>, and Giovanni Santi used it for his precious
but unpoetical Chronicle of Italian affairs. Both Benivieni and
Michelangelo Buonarroti composed elegies in this meter; and numerous
didactic eclogues of the pastoral poets might be cited in which it
served for analogue to Latin elegiacs. In the <i>Sacre Rappresentazioni</i>
it sometimes interrupted <i>ottava rima</i>, on the occasion of a set
discourse or sermon.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Both Ariosto and Alamanni employed it in their
satires. From these brief notices it will be seen that <i>terza rima</i>
during the Renaissance period was reserved for dissertational, didactic
and satiric themes, the Capitoli of the burlesque poets being parodies
of grave scholastic lucu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">-173-</a></span>brations. But no one now attempted an heroic
poem in this verse.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>To give a full account of Italian prose during this period of transition
from the middle age to the Renaissance is not easy. At the close of the
fourteenth century, S. Catherine of Siena sustained the purity and
&quot;dove-like simplicity&quot; of the earlier <i>trecento</i> style, with more of
fervor and personal power than any subsequent writer. Her letters,
whether addressed to Popes and princes on the politics of Italy, or
dealing with private topics of religious experience, are models of the
purest Tuscan diction.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> They have the garrulity and over-unctuous
sweetness of the <i>Fioretti</i> and <i>Leggende</i>. But these qualities,
peculiar to medieval piety among Italians, are balanced by untutored
eloquence which borders on sublimity. Without deliberate art or literary
aim, the spirit of a noble woman speaks from the heart in Catherine's
letters. The fervor of her feeling suggests poetic imagery. The justice
of her perception dictates weighty sentences. The intensity with which
she realizes the unseen world of spiritual emotion, gives dramatic
movement to her exhortations, expositions and entreaties. These rare
excellences of a style, where spontaneity surpasses artifice, are
combined in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">-174-</a></span>famous epistle to her confessor, Raimondo da Capua,
describing the execution of Niccol&#242; Tuldo.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> He was a young man of
Perugia, condemned to death for some act of insubordination. Catherine
visited him in prison, and induced him to take the Sacrament with her
for the first time. He besought her to be present with him at the place
of execution. Accordingly she waited for him there, praying to Mary and
to Catherine, the virgin saint of Alexandria, laying her own neck upon
the block, and entering into harmony so rapt with those celestial
presences that the multitude of men who were around her disappeared from
view. What followed, must be told in her own words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Poi egli giunse, come uno agnello mansueto: e vedendomi,
cominci&#242; a ridere; e volse che io gli facesse il segno della
croce. E ricevuto il segno, dissi io: &quot;Giuso! alle nozze,
fratello mio dolce! ch&#232; tosto sarai alla vita durabile.&quot;
Posesi qu&#236; con grande mansuetudine; e io gli distesi il collo,
e chin&#224;mi gi&#249;, e rammentalli il sangue dell'Agnello. La bocca
sua non diceva se non, Ges&#249;, e Catarina. E, cos&#236; dicendo,
ricevetti il capo nelle mani mie, fermando l'occhio nella
divina bont&#224; e dicendo: &quot;Io voglio.&quot;</p>

<p>Allora si vedeva Dio-e-Uomo, come si vedesse la chiarit&#224; del
sole; e stava aperto, e riceveva il sangue; nel sangue suo uno
fuoco di desiderio santo, dato e nascosto nell'anima sua per
grazia; riceveva nel fuoco della divina sua carit&#224;. Poich&#232;
ebbe ricevuto il sangue e il desiderio suo, ed egli ricevette
l'anima sua, la quale mise nella bottiga aperta del costato
suo, pieno di misericordia; manifestando la prima Verit&#224; che
per sola grazia e misericordia egli il riceveva, e non per
veruna altra operazione. O quanto era dolce e inestimable a
vedere la bont&#224; di Dio!</p>
</div>

<p>The sudden transition from this narrative of fact to the vision of
Christ&#8212;from the simple style of ordinary speech to ecstasy inebriated
with the cross&#8212;is managed with a power that truth alone could yield.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">-175-</a></span> A
dramatist might have conceived it; but only a saint who lived habitually
in both worlds of loving service and illumination, could thus have made
it natural. This is the noblest and the rarest realism.</p>

<p>If we trust the testimony of contemporary chroniclers, S. Bernardino of
Siena in the pulpit shared Catherine's power of utterance, at once
impressive and simple.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> No doubt the preachers of the <i>quattrocento</i>
were influential in maintaining a tradition of prose rhetoric. But it is
not in the nature of sermons, even when ably reported, to preserve their
fullness and their force. Not less important for the formation of a
literary style were the letters and dispatches of embassadors. Though at
this period all ceremonial orations, briefs, state documents and
epistles between Courts and commonwealths were composed in Latin, still
the secret correspondence of envoys with their home governments gave
occasion for the use of the vernacular; and even humanists expressed
their thoughts occasionally in the mother tongue. Coluccio Salutati, for
example, whose Latin letters were regarded as models of epistolary
style, employed Italian in less formal communications with his office.
These early documents of studied Tuscan writing are now more precious
than his formal Ciceronian imitations. Private letters may also be
mentioned among the best sources for studying the growth of Italian
prose, although we have not much material to judge by.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">-176-</a></span>The
correspondence of Alessandra degli Strozzi, recently edited by Signor
Cesare Guasti, is not only valuable for the light it casts upon
contemporary manners, but also for the illustration of the Florentine
idiom as written by a woman of noble birth.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Of Poliziano's, Pulci's
and Lorenzo de' Medici's letters I shall have occasion to speak in a
somewhat different connection later on.</p>

<p>The historiographers of the Renaissance thought it below their dignity
to use any language but Latin.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> At the same time, vernacular
annalists abounded in Italy, whose labors were of no small value in
forming the prose-style of the <i>quattrocento</i>. After the Villani,
Florence could boast a whole chain of writers, beginning with Marchionne
Stefani, including Gino Capponi, the spirited chronicler of the Ciompi
rebellion, and extending to Goro Dati in the middle of the fifteenth
century. A little later, Giovanni Cavalcanti, in his Florentine
Histories, proved how the simple diction of the preceding age was being
spoiled by false classicism.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> This work is doubly valuable&#8212;both as
a record of the great Albizzi oligarchy and their final conquest by the
Medici, and also as a monument of the fusion which was being made
between the popular and humanistic styles. The chronicles of other
Italian cities&#8212;Ferrara, Cremona, Rome, Pisa, Bologna, and even
Siena&#8212;show less purity of language than the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">-177-</a></span>Florentine.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Italian
is often mixed with vulgar Latin, and phrases borrowed from unpolished
local dialects abound. It was not until the close of the century that
two great writers of history in the vernacular arose outside the walls
of Florence. These were Corio, the historian of Milan, and Matarazzo,
the annalist of Perugia.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> In Corio's somewhat stiff and cumbrous
periods we trace the effort of a foreigner to gain by study what the
Tuscans owed to nature. Yet he never suffered this stylistic
preoccupation to spoil his qualities as an historian. His voluminous
narrative is a mine of accurate information, illustrated with vivid
pictures of manners and carefully considered portraits of eminent men.
Reading it, we cannot but regret that Poggio and Bruno, Navagero and
Bembo, judged it necessary to tell the tales of Florence and of Venice
in a pseudo-Livian Latin. The &quot;History of Milan&quot; is worth twenty of such
humanistic exercises in rhetoric. Matarazzo displays excellences of a
different, but of a rarer order. Unlike Corio, he was not anxious to
show familiarity with rules of Tuscan writing, or to build again the
periods of Boccaccio's ceremonious style. His language bears the stamp
of its Perugian origin. It is, at the same time, unaffectedly dramatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">-178-</a></span>and penetrated with the charm of a distinguished personality. No one
can read the tragedy of the Baglioni in this wonderful romance without
acknowledging that he is in the hands of a great writer. The limpidity
of the <i>trecento</i> has here survived, and, blending with Renaissance
enthusiasm for physical beauty and antique heroism, has produced a work
of art unrivaled in its kind.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>Having advanced so far as to speak in this chapter of Corio and
Matarazzo, I shall take occasion to notice a book which, appearing for
the first time in 1476, may fairly be styled the most important work of
Italian prose-fiction belonging to the fifteenth century. This is the
<i>Novellino</i> of Masuccio Guardato, a nobleman of Salerno, secretary to
the Prince Roberto Sanseverino, and resident throughout his life at the
Court of Naples.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> The <i>Novellino</i> is a collection of stories, fifty
in number, arranged in five parts, which treat respectively of hypocrisy
and the monastic vices, jealousy, feminine incontinence, the contrasts
of pathos and of humor, and the generosity of princes. Each <i>Novella</i> is
dedicated to a noble man or woman of Neapolitan society, and is followed
by a reflective discourse, in which the author personally addresses his
audience. Masuccio declares himself the disciple of Boccaccio and
Juvenal.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Of the Roman poet's spirit he has plenty; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">-179-</a></span>he gives the
rein to rage in language of the most indignant virulence. Of Boccaccio's
idiom and style, though we can trace the student's emulation, he can
boast but little. Masuccio never reached the Latinistic smoothness of
his model; and while he wrote Italian, his language was far from being
Tuscan. Phrases culled from southern dialects are frequent; and the
structure of the period is often ungrammatical. Masuccio was not a
member of any humanistic clique. He lived among the nobles of a royal
Court, and knew the common people intimately. This double experience is
reflected in his language and his modes of thought. Both are unalloyed
by pedantry, and precious for the student of contemporary manners.</p>

<p>The interest of the <i>Novellino</i> is great when we regard it as the third
collection of <i>Novelle</i>, coming after Boccaccio's and Sacchetti's, and,
from the point of view of art, occupying a middle place between them.
The tales of the Decameron were originally recited at Naples; and though
Boccaccio was a thorough Tuscan, he borrowed something from the south
which gave width, warmth and largeness to his writing. Masuccio is
wholly Neapolitan in tone; but he seeks such charm of presentation and
variety of matter as shall make his book worthy to take rank in general
literature. Sacchetti has more of a purely local flavor. He is no less
Florentine than Masuccio is Neapolitan; and, unlike Masuccio, he has
taken little pains to adapt his work to other readers than his
fellow-citizens. Boccaccio embraces all human life, seen in the light of
vivid fancy by a <i>bourgeois</i> who was also a great comic romantic poet.
Sacchetti describes the <i>borghi</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">-180-</a></span> <i>contrade</i>, and <i>piazze</i> of Florence;
and his speech is seasoned with rare Tuscan salt of wit. Masuccio's
world is that of the free-living southern noble. He is penetrated with
aristocratic feeling, treats willingly of arms and jousts and warfare,
telling the tales of knights and ladies to a courtly company.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> At
the same time, the figures of the people move with incomparable vivacity
across the stage; and his transcripts from life reveal the careless
interpenetration of classes to which he was accustomed in Calabria.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
Some of his stories are as simply <i>bourgeois</i> as any of
Sacchetti's.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>When we compare Masuccio with Boccaccio we find many points of
divergence, due to differences of temperament, social sympathies and
local circumstance. Boccaccio is witty and malicious; Masuccio humorous
and poignant. Boccaccio laughs indulgently at vices; Masuccio scourges
them. Boccaccio makes a jest of superstition; Masuccio thunders against
the hypocrites who bring religion into contempt. Boccaccio turns the
world round for his recreation, submitting its follies to the subtle
play of analytical fancy. Masuccio is terribly in earnest; whether
sympathetic or vituperative, he makes the voice of his heart heard.
Boccaccio's pictures are toned with a rare perception of harmony and
delicate gradation. Masuccio brings what strikes his sense before us by
a few firm touches. Boccaccio <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">-181-</a></span>shows far finer literary tact. Yet there
is something in the unpremeditated passion, pathos, humor, grossness,
anger and enjoyment of Masuccio&#8212;a chord of masculine and native
strength, a note of vigorous reality&#8212;that arrests attention even more
imperiously than the prepared effects of the Decameron. One point of
undoubted excellence can be claimed for Masuccio. He was a great tragic
artist in the rough, and his comedy displays an uncouth Rabelaisian
realism. The lights and shadows cast upon his scene are brusque&#8212;like
the sunlight and the shadow on a Southern city; whereas the painting of
Boccaccio is distinguished by exquisite blendings of color and
chiaroscuro in subordination to the chosen key.</p>

<p>Masuccio displays his real power in his serious <i>Novelle</i>, when he gives
vent to his furious hatred of a godless clergy, or describes some
dreadful incident, like the tragedy of the two lovers in the
lazar-house.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Scarcely less dramatic are his tales of comic
sensuality.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Nor has he a less vivid sense of beauty. Some of his
occasional pictures&#8212;the meeting of youths and maidens in the evening
light of Naples; the lover who changed his jousting-badge because his
lady was untrue; the tournament at Rimini; the portrait of Eugenia
disguised as a <i>ragazzo de omo d'arme</i>&#8212;break upon us with the freshness
of a smile or sunbeam.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">-182-</a></span>We might almost detect a vein of Spanish
imagination in certain of his episodes&#8212;in the midnight ride of the
living monk after the dead friar strapped upon his palfrey, and in the
ghastly murder of the woman and the dwarf.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> The lowest classes of
the people are presented with a salience worthy of Velasquez&#8212;cobblers,
tailors, prostitutes, preaching friars, miracle-workers, relic-mongers,
bawds, ruffians, lepers, highway robbers, gondoliers, innkeepers,
porters, Moorish slaves, the panders to base appetites and every sort of
sin.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Masuccio felt no compunction in portraying vicious people as
he knew them; but he reserved language of scathing vituperation for
their enormities.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>From so much that is coarse, dreadful, and revolting, the romance of
Masuccio's more genial tales detaches itself with charming grace and
delicacy. Nothing in Boccaccio is lovelier than the story of the girl
who puts on armor and goes at night to kill her faithless lover; or that
of Mariotto and Giannozza, which is substantially the same as Romeo and
Juliet; or that of Virginio Baglioni and Eugenia, surprised and slain by
robbers near Brescia; or that of Marchetto and Lanzilao, the comrades in
arms, which has points in common with Palamon and Arcite; or, lastly,
that of the young Malem and his education by Giu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">-183-</a></span>dotto Gambacorto.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>.
It is the blending of so many elements&#8212;the interweaving of tragedy and
comedy, satire and pathos, grossness and sentiment, in a style of
unadorned sincerity, that places Masuccio high among novelists. Had his
language been as pure as that of the earlier Tuscan or the later Italian
authors, he would probably rank only second to Boccaccio in the
estimation even of his fellow-countrymen. A foreigner, less sensitive to
niceties of idiom, may be excused for recognizing him as at least
Bandello's equal in the story-teller's art. In moral quality he is
superior not only to Bandello, but also to Boccaccio.</p>

<p>The greatest writer of Italian prose in the fifteenth century was a man
of different stamp from Masuccio. Gifted with powers short only of the
very highest, Leo Battista Alberti exercised an influence over the
spirit of his age and race which was second to none but Lionardo's.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
Sacchetti, Ser Giovanni, Masuccio, and the ordinary tribe of chroniclers
pretended to no humanistic culture.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Alberti, on the contrary, was
educated at Bologna, where he acquired the scientific knowledge of his
age, together with such complete mastery of Latin that a work of his
youth, the comedy <i>Philodoxius</i>, passed for a genuine product of
antiquity. This man of many-sided genius came into the world too soon
for the perfect exercise of his singular facul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">-184-</a></span>ties. Whether we regard
him from the point of of art, of science, or of literature, he occupies
in each department the position of precursor, pioneer and indicator.
Always original and always fertile, he prophesied of lands he was not
privileged to enter, leaving the memory of dim and varied greatness
rather than any solid monument behind him.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Of his mechanical
discoveries this is not the place to speak; nor can I estimate the value
of his labors in the science of perspective.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> It is as a man of
letters that he comes before us in this chapter.</p>

<p>The date of Alberti's birth is uncertain. But we may fix it probably at
about the year 1405. He was born at Venice, where his father, exiled
with the other members of his noble house by the Albizzi, had taken
refuge. After Cosimo de' Medici's triumph over the Albizzi in 1434, Leo
Battista returned to Florence.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> It was as a Florentine citizen that
his influence in restoring the vulgar literature to honor, was destined
to be felt. He did not, however, reside continuously <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">-185-</a></span>in the city of his
ancestors, but moved from town to town, with a restlessness that savored
somewhat of voluntary exile. It is, indeed, noteworthy how many of the
greatest Italians&#8212;Dante, Giotto, Petrarch, Alberti, Lionardo, Tasso:
men who powerfully helped to give the nation intellectual
coherence&#8212;were wanderers. They sought their home and saw their
spiritual <i>patria</i> in no one abiding-place.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Thus, amid the
political distractions of the Italian people, rose that ideal of unity
to which Rome, Naples, Florence, Venice, Ferrara contributed, but which
owned no metropolis. Florence remained to the last the brain of Italy.
Yet Florence, by stepmotherly ingratitude, by Dante's exile, by the
alienation of Petrarch, by Alberti's homeless boyhood, prepared for the
race a new culture, Tuscan in origin, national by diffusion and
assimilation. Alberti died at Rome in 1472, just when Poliziano, a youth
of eighteen, was sounding the first notes of that music which
re-awakened the Muse of Tuscany from her long sleep, and gave new
melodies to Italy.</p>

<p>In his proemium to the Third Book of the <i>Family</i>, addressed to
Francesco degli Alberti, Leo Battista enlarges on the duty of
cultivating the mother tongue.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> After propounding the question
whether the loss of the empire acquired by their Roman
ancestors&#8212;<i>l'antiquo nostro imperio amplissimo</i>&#8212;or the loss of Latin
as a spoken language&#8212;<i>l'antiqua nostra gentilissima <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">-186-</a></span>lingua
latina</i>&#8212;had been the greater privation to the Italian race, he gives it
as his opinion that, though the former robbed them of imperial dignity,
the latter was the heavier misfortune. To repair that loss is the duty
of one who had made literature his study. If he desires to benefit his
fellow-countrymen, he will not use a dead language, imperfectly
comprehended by a few learned men, but will bend the idiom of the people
to the needs of erudition. &quot;I willingly admit,&quot; he argues, &quot;that the
ancient Latin tongue is very copious and of beauty polished to
perfection. Yet I do not see what our Tuscan has in it so hateful that
worthy matter, when conveyed thereby, should be displeasing to us.&quot;
Pedants who despise their mother speech, are mostly men incapable of
expressing themselves in the latter; &quot;and granted they are right in
saying that the ancient tongue has undisputed authority, because so many
learned men have employed it, the like honor will certainly be paid our
language of to-day, if men of culture take the pains to purify and
polish it.&quot; He then declares that, meaning to be useful to the members
of his house, and to bequeath a record of their ancient dignity to their
descendants, he has resolved to choose the tongue in which he will be
generally understood.</p>

<p>This proemium explains Alberti's position in all his Italian writings.
Aiming at the general good, convinced that a living nation cannot use a
dead language with dignity and self-respect, he makes the sacrifice of a
scholar's pride to public utility, and has the sense to perceive that
the day of erudite exclusiveness is over. No one felt more than Alberti
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">-187-</a></span> greatness of the antique Roman race. No one was prouder of his
descent from those patricians of the Commonwealth, who tamed and ruled
the world. The memory of that Roman past, which turned the generation
after Dante into a nation of students, glowed in Alberti's breast with
more than common fervor.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The sonorous introduction to the first
book of the <i>Family</i> reviews the glories of the Empire and the decadence
of Rome with a pomp of phrase, a passion of eloquence, that stir our
spirit like the tramp of legions waking echoes in a ruined Roman
colonnade.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Yet in spite of this devotion to the past, Alberti, like
Villani, felt that his Italians of the modern age had destinies and
auspices apart from those of ancient Rome. He was resolved to make the
speech of that new nation, heiress of the Latin name, equal in dignity
to Cicero's and Livy's. What Rome had done, Rome's children should do
again. But the times were changed, and Alberti was a true son of the
Renaissance. He approached his task in the spirit of a humanist. His
style is over-charged with Latinisms; his periods are cumbrous; his
matter is loaded with citations and scholastic instances drawn from the
rep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">-188-</a></span>ertories of erudition.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> The <i>vivida vis</i> of inspiration fails.
His work is full of reminiscences. The golden simplicity of the
<i>trecento</i> yields to a studied effort after dignity of diction, culture
of amplitude. Still the writer's energy is felt in massive paragraphs of
powerful declamation. His eloquence does not degenerate into frothy
rhetoric; and when he wills, he finds pithy phrases to express the mind
of a philosopher and poet. That he was born and reared in exile accounts
for a lack of racy Tuscan in his prose; and the structure of his
sentences proves that he had been accustomed to think in Latin before he
made Italian serve his turn.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Still, though for these and other
reasons his works were not of the kind to animate a nation, they are
such as still may be read with profit and with pleasure by men who seek
for solid thoughts in noble diction.</p>

<p>Alberti's principal prose work, the <i>Trattato della Famiglia</i>, was
written to instruct the members of his family in the customs of their
ancestors, and to perpetuate those virtues of domestic life which he
regarded as the sound foundation of a commonwealth. The first three
books are said to have been composed within the space of ninety days in
Rome, and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">-189-</a></span>fourth added at a later period.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> It is a dialogue,
the interlocutors being relatives of the Alberti blood. Nearly all the
illustrative matter is drawn from the biographies of their forefathers.
The scene is laid at Padua, and the essay contains frequent allusions to
their exile.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> No word of invective against the Albizzi who had
ruined them, no vituperation of the city which had permitted the
expulsion of her sons, escapes the lips of any of the speakers. The
grave sadness that tempers the whole dialogue, is marred by neither
animosity nor passion. Yet though the <i>Family</i> was written in exile for
exiles, the ideal of domestic life it paints, is Florentine.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Taken
in its whole extent, this treatise is the most valuable document which
remains to us from the times of the oligarchy, when Florence was waging
war with the Visconti, and before the Medici had based their despotism
upon popular favor. From its pages a tolerably complete history of a
great commercial family <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">-190-</a></span>might be extracted; and this study would form a
valuable commentary on the public annals of the commonwealth during the
earlier portion of the fifteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>The first book of the <i>Famiglia</i> deals with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">-191-</a></span> duties of the elder to
the younger members of the household, and the observance owed by sons
and daughters to their parents. It is an essay <i>De Officiis</i> within the
circle of the home, embracing minute particulars of conduct, and
suggesting rules for education from the cradle upwards.<a name="FNanchor_227_228" id="FNanchor_227_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_228" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The second
book takes up the question of matrimony. The respective ages at which
the sexes ought to marry, the moral and physical qualities of a good
wife, the maintenance of harmony between a wedded couple, their separate
provinces and common duty to the State in the procreation of children,
are discussed with scientific completeness. The third book, modeled on
the <i>&#338;conomicus</i> of Xenophon, is devoted to thrift. How to use our
personal faculties, our wealth, and our time to best advantage, forms
its principal theme. The fourth book treats of friendship&#8212;family
connections and alliances, the usefulness of friends in good and evil
fortune, the mutual benefits enjoyed by men who live honestly together
in a social state.<a name="FNanchor_228_229" id="FNanchor_228_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_229" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> It may be seen <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">-192-</a></span>from this sketch that the
architecture of the treatise is complete and symmetrical. The first book
establishes the principles of domestic morality on which a family exists
and flourishes. The second provides for its propagation through
marriage. The third shows how its resources are to be distributed and
preserved. The fourth explains its relations to similar communities
existing in an organized society. Many passages in the essay have
undoubtedly the air of truisms; but this impression of commonplaceness
is removed by the strong specific character of all the illustrations.
Alberti's wisdom is common to civilized humanity. His conception of life
is such as only suits a Florentine, and his examples are drawn from the
annals of a single family.</p>

<p>I have already dwelt at some length in a former volume on the most
celebrated section of this treatise&#8212;the <i>Padre di Famiglia</i> or the
<i>Economico</i>.<a name="FNanchor_229_230" id="FNanchor_229_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_230" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> To repeat those observations here would be
superfluous. Yet I cannot avoid a digression upon a matter of much
obscurity relating to the authorship of that book.<a name="FNanchor_230_231" id="FNanchor_230_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_231" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Until recently,
this discourse upon the economy of a Florentine household passed under
the name of Agnolo Pandolfini, and was published separately as his
undoubted work. The interlocutors in the dialogue, which bore the title
of <i>Governo della <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">-193-</a></span>Famiglia</i>, are various members of the Pandolfini
family, and all allusions to the Alberti and their exile are wanting.
The style of the <i>Governo</i> differs in many important respects from that
of Alberti; and yet the arrangement of the material and the substance of
each paragraph are so closely similar in both forms of the treatise as
to prove that the work is substantially identical. Pandolfini's essay,
which I shall call <i>Il Governo</i>, passes for one of the choicest
monuments of ancient Tuscan diction. Alberti's <i>Economico</i>, though it is
more idiomatic than the rest of his <i>Famiglia</i>, betrays the Latinisms of
a scholar. It is clear from a comparison of the two treatises either
that Alberti appropriated Pandolfini's <i>Governo</i>, brought its style into
harmony with his own, and gave it a place between the second and the
fourth books of his essay on the Family; or else that this third book of
Alberti's <i>Famiglia</i> was rewritten by an author who commanded a purer
Italian. In the former case, Alberti changed the <i>dramatis person&#230;</i> by
substituting members of his own house for the Pandolfini. In the latter
case, the anonymous compiler paid a similar compliment to the Pandolfini
by such alterations as obliterated the Alberti, and presented the
treatise to the world as part of their own history. That Agnolo
Pandolfini was himself guilty of this plagiarism is rendered improbable
by a variety of circumstances. Yet the problem does not resolve itself
into the simple question whether Pandolfini or Alberti was the plagiary.
Supposing Alberti to have been the original author, there is no
difficulty in believing that the <i>Governo</i> was a redaction made from his
work by some anonymous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">-194-</a></span> hand in honor of the Pandolfini family. On the
contrary, if we assume Agnolo Pandolfini to have been the author, then
Alberti himself was guilty of a gross and open plagiarism.<a name="FNanchor_231_232" id="FNanchor_231_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_232" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>It will be useful to give some account of the MSS. upon which the
editions of the <i>Governo</i> and the <i>Economico</i> are based.<a name="FNanchor_232_233" id="FNanchor_232_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_233" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> In the
first edition of the <i>Governo</i> (Tartini e Franchi, Firenze, 1734) six
codices are mentioned. Of these the Codex Pandolfini A, on which the
editors chiefly relied, has been removed from Italy to Paris. The Codex
Pandolfini B was written in 1476 at Poggibonsi by a certain Giuliano di
Niccolajo Martini. Whether the Codex Pandolfini A professed to be an
autograph copy, I do not know; but the editors of 1734, referring to it,
state that the Senator Filippo Pandolfini, member of the Della Crusca,
corrected the errors, restored the text, and improved the diction of the
treatise by the help of a still more ancient MS. This admission on their
part is significant. It opens, for the advocates of Alberti's
authorship, innumerable suspicions as to the part played by Filippo
Pandolfini in the preparation of the <i>Governo</i>. Nor can it be denied
that the lack of an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">-195-</a></span>autograph of the <i>Governo</i> renders the settlement
of the disputed question very difficult.</p>

<p>Of Alberti's <i>Trattato della Famiglia</i> we have three autograph copies;
(i) Cod. Magl. Classe iv. No. 38 in folio; (ii) Riccardiana 1220; (iii)
Riccardiana 176. The first of these is the most important; but it
presents some points of singularity. In the first place, the third book,
which is the <i>Economico</i>, has been inserted into the original codex, and
shows a different style of writing. In the second place, the first two
books contain numerous corrections, additions, erasures and
recorrections, obviously made by Alberti himself. Some of the
interpolated passages in the first two books are found to coincide with
parts of the <i>Governo</i>; and Signor Cortesi, to whose critical Study I
have already referred, argues with great show of reason that Alberti,
when he determined to incorporate the <i>Governo</i> in his <i>Famiglia</i>,
enriched the earlier books of that essay with fragments which he did not
find it convenient to leave in their original place. Still it should be
remembered that this argument can be reversed; for the anonymous
compiler of the <i>Governo</i>, if he had access to Alberti's autograph, may
have chosen to appropriate sentences culled from the earlier portions of
the <i>Famiglia</i>.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that the <i>Economico</i>, even though it forms the third
book of the Treatise on the Family, has a separate title and a separate
introduction, with a dedication to Francesco Alberti, and a distinct
peroration.<a name="FNanchor_233_234" id="FNanchor_233_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_234" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> It is, in fact, an independent composition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">-196-</a></span> and occurs
in more than one MS. of the fifteenth century detached from the rest of
the <i>Famiglia</i>. In style it is far freer and more racy than is usual
with Alberti's writing. Of this its author seems to have been aware; for
he expressly tells his friend and kinsman Francesco that he has sought
to approach the purity and simplicity of Xenophon.<a name="FNanchor_234_235" id="FNanchor_234_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_235" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>The anonymous writer of Alberti's life says that he composed three books
on the Family at Rome before he was thirty, and a fourth book three
years later. If we follow Tiraboschi in taking 1414 for the date of his
birth, the first three books must have been composed before 1444 and the
fourth in 1447. The former of these dates (1444) receives some
confirmation from a Latin letter written by Leonardo Dati to Alberti,
acknowledging the Treatise on the Family, in June 1443. Dati tells him
that he finds fault with the essay for being composed &quot;in a more
majestic and perhaps a harsher style, especially in the first book, than
the Florentine language and the judgment of the laity would tolerate.&quot;
He goes on, however, to observe that &quot;afterwards the language becomes
far more sweet and satisfactory to the ear&quot;&#8212;a criticism which seems to
suit the altered manner of the third book. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">-197-</a></span> reference to the date
1447, in which the <i>Famiglia</i> may have been completed, Cortesi remarks
that Pandolfini died in 1446. He suggests that, upon this event, Alberti
appropriated the <i>Governo</i> and rewrote it, and that the <i>Economico</i>,
though it holds the place of the third book in the treatise, is really
the fourth book mentioned by the anonymous biographer. The suggestion is
ingenious; and if we can once bring ourselves to believe that Alberti
committed a deliberate act of larceny, immediately after his friend
Pandolfini's death, then the details which have been already given
concerning the autograph of the <i>Famiglia</i> and the discrepancies in its
style of composition add confirmation to the theory. There are, however,
good reasons for assigning Alberti's birth to the year 1404 or even
1402.<a name="FNanchor_235_236" id="FNanchor_235_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_236" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> In that case Alberti's Roman residence would fall into the
third decade of the century, and the last book of the <i>Famiglia</i> (which
I am inclined to believe is the one now called the third) would have
been composed before Pandolfini's death. That Alberti kept his MSS. upon
the stocks and subjected them to frequent revision is certain; and this
may account for one reference occurring in it to an event which happened
in 1438.</p>

<p>Is it rational to adopt the hypothesis of Alberti's plagiarism? Let us
distinctly understand what it implies. In his own preface to the
<i>Economico</i> Alberti states that he has striven to reproduce the simple
and intelligible style of Xenophon<a name="FNanchor_236_237" id="FNanchor_236_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_237" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>; and there is no doubt that this
portion of the <i>Famiglia</i>, whether we regard it as Alberti's or as
Pandolfini's property, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">-198-</a></span>was closely modeled on the <i>&#338;conomicus</i>.
Cortesi suggests that the reference to Xenophon was purposely introduced
by Alberti in order to put his readers off the scent. Nor, if we accept
the hypothesis of plagiarism, can we restrict ourselves to this
accusation merely. In the essay <i>Della Tranquillit&#224; dell'Animo</i> Alberti
introduces Agnolo Pandolfini as an interlocutor, and makes him refer to
the third book of the <i>Famiglia</i> as a genuine production of
Alberti.<a name="FNanchor_237_238" id="FNanchor_237_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_238" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> In other words, he must not only have appropriated
Pandolfini's work, and laid claim to it in the preface to his
<i>Economico</i>; but he must also have referred to it as his own composition
in a speech ascribed to the real author, which he meant for publication.
That is to say, he made the man whose work he stole pronounce its
panegyric and refer it to the thief. That Pandolfini was dead when he
committed these acts of treason would not be sufficient to explain
Alberti's audacity; for according to the advocates of Pandolfini's
authorship, the MS. formed a known and valued portion of his sons'
inheritance. Is it <i>prim&#226; facie</i> probable that Alberti, even in those
days of looser literary copyright than ours, should have exposed himself
to detection in so palpable and gross a fraud?</p>

<p>Before answering this question in the affirmative, it may be asked what
positive grounds there are for crediting Pandolfini with the original
authorship. At present no autograph of Pandolfini is forthcoming. His
claim to authorship rests on tradition, and on the Pandolfini cast of
the dialogue in certain MSS. At the same time, the admissions made by
the editors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">-199-</a></span> of 1734 regarding their most trusted codex have been
already shown to be suspicious. It is also noticeable that Vespasiano,
in his Life of Agnolo Pandolfini, though he professes to have been
intimately acquainted with this excellent Florentine burgher, does not
mention the <i>Governo della Famiglia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_238_239" id="FNanchor_238_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_239" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The omission is singular,
supposing the treatise to have then existed under Pandolfini's name, for
Vespasiano was himself a writer of Italian in an age when Latin
scholarship claimed almost exclusive attention. He would, we should have
thought, have been eager to name so distinguished a man among his
fellow-authors in the vulgar tongue.</p>

<p>Granting the force of these considerations, it must still be admitted
that there remain grave objections to accepting the <i>Economico</i> of
Alberti as the original of these two treatises. In the first place, the
<i>Governo</i> is a masterpiece of Tuscan; and it is far more reasonable to
suppose that the <i>Economico</i> was copied from the <i>Governo</i> with such
alterations as adapted it to the manner of the <i>Famiglia</i>, than to
assume that the <i>Economico</i> received a literary rehandling which reduced
it from its more rhetorical to a popular form. The passage from simple
to complex in literature admits of easier explanation than the reverse
process. Moreover, if Alberti admired a racy Tuscan style and could
command it for the <i>Economico</i>, why did he not continue to use it in his
subsequent compositions? In the second place, the <i>Governo</i>, as it
stands, is suited to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">-200-</a></span> what Vespasiano tells us about Agnolo Pandolfini.
He was a scholar trained in the humanities of the earlier Renaissance
and a statesman who retired from public life, disgusted with the times,
to studious leisure at his villa. Now, Giannozzo Alberti, who takes the
chief part in the <i>Economico</i>, proclaims himself a man of business,
without learning. Those passages of the <i>Governo</i> which seem
inappropriate to such a character are absent from the <i>Economico</i>; but
some of them appear in Alberti's other works, the <i>Teogenio</i> and <i>Della
Tranquillit&#224;</i>. From this circumstance Signor Cortesi infers that
Alberti, working with Pandolfini's essay before him, made such
alterations as brought the drift of the discourse within the scope of
Giannozzo's acquirements. The advocates of Alberti's authorship are
bound to reverse this theory, and to assume that the author of the
<i>Governo</i> suited the <i>Economico</i> to Pandolfini by infusing a tincture of
scholarship into Giannozzo's speeches.<a name="FNanchor_239_240" id="FNanchor_239_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_240" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>We have still to ask who could the author of the <i>Governo</i>, if it was
not Agnolo Pandolfini, have been? The first answer to this question is:
Alberti himself. The anonymous biographer tells us that he wrote the
first three books at Rome, and that he afterwards made great efforts to
improve his Tuscan style and render it more popular. It is not,
therefore, impossible that he should himself have fitted that portion of
his <i>Famiglia</i> with new characters, omitted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">-201-</a></span> Alberti, and given the
honors of the dialogue to Pandolfini. The treatise, as he first planned
it (according to this hypothesis), has a passionate digression upon the
exile of the Alberti, followed by a declamation against public life and
politicians. To have circulated these passages in an essay intended for
Florentine readers, after Alberti's recall by Cosimo de' Medici, would
have been unwise. Alberti, therefore, may only have retained such
portions of them as could rouse no animosity, revive no painful
reminiscences, and be appropriately placed upon the lips of Pandolfini.
As it stands in the <i>Governo</i>, the invective against statecraft is
scarcely in keeping with Pandolfini's character. Though he retired from
public life disgusted and ill at ease, the conclusion that no man should
seek to serve the State except from a strict sense of duty, sounds
strange when spoken by this veteran politician. Taken as the climax to
the history of the wrongs inflicted upon the Alberti, this passage is
dramatically in harmony with Giannozzo's experience.<a name="FNanchor_240_241" id="FNanchor_240_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_241" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> With regard to
the noticeable improvement of style in the <i>Economico</i>, we might argue
that after Alberti had enjoyed facilities at Florence of acquiring his
native idiom, he remodeled that section of his earlier work which he
intended for the people. And the same line of argument would account for
the independence of the <i>Economico</i> and its occurrence in separate MSS.
Had Alberti designed what we now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">-202-</a></span> call a plagiarism, what need was there
to call attention to it by prefixing an introduction to the third book
of a continuous treatise?</p>

<p>It is not, however, necessary to defend Alberti from the charge of fraud
by suggesting that he was himself the author of the <i>Governo</i>. There
existed, as we shall soon see, a class of semi-cultivated scribes at
Florence, whose business consisted in manufacturing literature for the
people. They re-wrote, re-fashioned, condensed, abstracted whatever
seemed to furnish entertainment and instruction for their public. Their
style was close to the vulgar speech and frankly idiomatic. That one of
these men should have made the necessary alterations in the third book
of the <i>Famiglia</i> to remove the recollection of the Alberti exile, and
to prepare it for popular reading, is by no means impossible. The
<i>Governo</i> is shorter and more condensed than the <i>Economico</i>. The
rhetorical and dramatic elements are reduced; and the material is
communicated in a style of gnomic pregnancy. If it was modeled upon the
<i>Economico</i> in the way I have suggested, the writer of the abstract was
a man of no common ability, with a very keen sense of language and a
faculty for investing a work of art and fine literature with the
<i>na&#239;vet&#233;</i> and grace of popular style. He also understood the necessity
of providing his chief interlocutor, Agnolo Pandolfini, with a character
different from that of Giannozzo Alberti; and he had the tact to realize
that character by innumerable touches. Great additional support would be
given to this hypothesis, if we could trust Bonucci's assertion that he
had seen and transcribed a MS. of the <i>Governo</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">-203-</a></span> adapted with a set of
characters selected from the Pazzi family. It would then seem clear that
the <i>Governo</i> was an essay which every father of a family wished to
possess for the instruction of his household, and to connect with the
past history of his own race. Unluckily, Signor Bonucci, though he
prints this Pazzi <i>rifacimento</i>, gives no information as to the source
of the MS. or any hint whereby its existence can be ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_241_242" id="FNanchor_241_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_242" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> We
must, therefore, omit it from our reckoning.</p>

<p>As the case at present stands, it is impossible to form a decisive
opinion regarding the authorship of this famous treatise. The necessary
critical examination of MSS. has not yet been made, and the arguments
used on either side from internal evidence are not conclusive. My own
prepossession is still in favor of Alberti. I may, however, observe that
after reading Signor Cortesi's inedited essay, I perceive the case in
favor of Pandolfini to be far stronger than I had expected.<a name="FNanchor_242_243" id="FNanchor_242_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_243" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>Space will not permit a full discussion of Alberti's numerous writings;
and yet their bearing on the best opinion of his time is so important
that some notice of them must be taken. Together with the <i>Famiglia</i> we
may class the <i>Deiciarchia</i>, or, as it should probably be written, the
<i>De Iciarchia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_243_244" id="FNanchor_243_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_244" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> This, like the majority of his moral treatises, is
a dialogue, and its subject is civic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">-204-</a></span>virtue. Having formed the ideal
family, he next considers the functions of householders, born to guide
the State. The chief point of the discourse is that no one should be
idle, but that all should labor in some calling worthy of the dignity of
man.<a name="FNanchor_244_245" id="FNanchor_244_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_245" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> This seems a simple doctrine; but it is so inculcated as to
make us remember the Guelf laws of Florence, whereby <i>scioperati</i> were
declared criminals. It must not, however, be supposed that Alberti
confines himself to the development of this single theme. His
<i>Deiciarchia</i> is rather to be regarded as a treatise on the personal
qualities of men to whom the conduct of a commonwealth has been by
accident of birth intrusted.</p>

<p>A second class of Alberti's dialogues discuss the contemplative life. In
the <i>Famiglia</i> and the <i>Deiciarchia</i> man is regarded as a social and
domestic being. In the <i>Tranquillit&#224; dell'Animo</i> and the <i>Teogenio</i> the
inner life of the student and the sage comes under treatment. The former
of these dialogues owes much of its interest to the interlocutors and to
the scene where it was laid.<a name="FNanchor_245_246" id="FNanchor_245_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_246" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Leon Battista Alberti, Niccol&#242; di Veri
dei Medici, and Agnolo Pandolfini meet inside the Florentine Duomo,
which is described in a few words of earnest admiration for its majesty
and strength.<a name="FNanchor_246_247" id="FNanchor_246_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_247" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> These friends begin a conversation, which soon turns
upon the means of preserving the mind in repose and avoiding
perturbations from the passions. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">-205-</a></span>The three books are enriched with
copious allusions to Alberti's works and personal habits&#8212;his skill as a
musician and a statuary, the gymnastic feats of his youth, and his
efforts to benefit the State by intellectual labor. They form a valuable
supplement to the anonymous biography. The philosophical material is too
immediately borrowed from Cicero and Seneca to be of much importance.
The <i>Teogenio</i> is a more attractive, and, as it seems to me, a riper
work.<a name="FNanchor_247_248" id="FNanchor_247_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_248" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Of Alberti's ethical discourses I am inclined to rate this
next to the <i>Famiglia</i>; nor did the Italian Renaissance produce any
disquisition of the kind more elevated in feeling, finer in temper, or
glowing with an eloquence at once so spontaneous and so dignified. We
have to return to Petrarch to find the same high humanistic passion; and
Alberti's Italian is here more winning than Petrarch's Latin. Had Pico
condescended to the vulgar tongue, he might have produced work of
similar quality; for the essay on the Dignity of Man is written in the
same spirit.</p>

<p>The <i>Teogenio</i> was sent with a letter of dedication to Lionelle d'Este
not long after his father's death.<a name="FNanchor_248_249" id="FNanchor_248_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_249" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Alberti apologizes for its
Italian style and assures the prince it had been written merely to
console him in his evil fortunes. The speakers are two, Teogenio and
Microtiro.<a name="FNanchor_249_250" id="FNanchor_249_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_250" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> The dialogue opens with a passage on <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">-206-</a></span>friendship, and a
somewhat labored description of the grove where Teogenio intends to pass
the day. Microtiro has come from the city. His friend, the recluse,
welcomes him to the country with these words: &quot;Ma sediamo, se cos&#236; ti
piace, qui fra questi mirti, in luogo non men delizioso che vostri
teatri e tempi amplissimi e sontuosissimi.&quot; This strikes the keynote of
the treatise, the theme of which is the superiority of study in the
country over the distractions of the town. Reading it, we see how
rightly Landino assigned his part to Alberti in the Camaldolese
Discussions.<a name="FNanchor_250_251" id="FNanchor_250_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_251" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> That ideal of rural solitude which the Italian
scholars inherited from their Roman forefathers, receives its earliest
and finest treatment in this dialogue. It is not communion with nature
so much as the companionship of books and the pursuit of study in a
tranquil corner of the Tuscan hills, that Alberti has selected for his
panegyric.<a name="FNanchor_251_252" id="FNanchor_251_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_252" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> &quot;The society of the illustrious dead,&quot; he says in one of
the noblest passages of the essay, &quot;can be enjoyed by me at leisure
here; and when I choose to converse with sages, politicians or great
poets, I have but to turn to my bookshelves, and my company is better
than your palaces with all their crowds of flatterers and clients can
afford.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_252_253" id="FNanchor_252_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_253" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> After enlarging on the manifold advantages of a student's
life, he concludes the book with a magnificent picture of human frailty,
leading up to a discourse on death.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that Alberti, though frequently approaching the subject
of religion, never dilates upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">-207-</a></span>it, and in no place declares himself a
Christian. His creed is that of the Roman moralists&#8212;a belief in the
benignant Maker of the Universe, an intellectual and unsubstantial
theism. We feel this even in that passage of the <i>Famiglia</i> when
Giannozzo and his wife pray in their bed-chamber to God for prosperity
in life and happiness in children.<a name="FNanchor_253_254" id="FNanchor_253_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_254" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> There is not a word about
spiritual blessings, no allusion to Christ or Madonna, though a silver
statue of the Saint with ivory hands and face is standing in his
tabernacle over them<a name="FNanchor_254_255" id="FNanchor_254_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_255" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>&#8212;nothing, indeed, to indicate that this grave
Florentine couple, whom we may figure to ourselves like Van Dyck's
merchant and wife in the National Gallery, were not performing sacrifice
and praying to the <i>Di Lares</i> of a Roman household. The Renaissance had
Latinized even the religious sentiments, and the elder faiths of the
middle ages were extinct in the soundest hearts of the epoch.<a name="FNanchor_255_256" id="FNanchor_255_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_256" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>A third group of Alberti's prose works consists of his essays on the
arts.<a name="FNanchor_256_257" id="FNanchor_256_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_257" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> One of these, the Treatise on Painting, was either written in
Italian or translated by Alberti soon after its composition in
Latin.<a name="FNanchor_257_258" id="FNanchor_257_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_258" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The Treatises on Perspective, Sculpture, Architecture and
the Orders are supposed to have been rendered by their author from the
Latin; but doubt still rests upon Alberti's share in this translation.
It is not my pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">-208-</a></span>sent business to inquire into the subject-matter of his
artistic essays, but rather to note the fact that Alberti should have
thought it fitting to use Italian for at least the most considerable of
them. We have already seen that his chief motive to composition was
utility and that he recognized the need of bringing the results of
learning within the scope of the unlettered laity. We need not doubt
that this consideration weighed with him when he rehandled the matter of
Vitruvius and Pliny for the use of handicraftsmen. Nothing is more
striking in the whole series than the business-like simplicity of style,
the avoidance of rhetoric, and the adaptation of each section to some
practical end. We have not here to do with &#230;sthetical criticism, but
with the condensed experience of a student and workman. In his
exposition of theory Alberti corresponds to the practice of Florence,
where Ghirlandajo kept a <i>bottega</i> open to all comers, and Michelangelo
began his apprenticeship by grinding colors.</p>

<p>Though the subject of these essays lies beyond the scope of my work, it
is impossible to pass over the dedication to Filippo Brunelleschi, which
is prefixed to the Italian version of the <i>Pittura</i>. Alberti begins by
saying that the wonder and sorrow begotten in him by reflecting on the
loss of many noble arts and sciences, had led him to believe that
Nature, wearied and out-worn, had no force left to generate the giant
spirits of her youth. &quot;But when I returned from the long exile in which
we of the Alberti have grown old, to this our mother-city, which exceeds
all others in the beauty of her monuments, I perceived that many living
men, but first of all you, Filippo, and our dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">-209-</a></span>est friend the sculptor
Donatello, and Lorenzo Ghiberti and Luca della Robbia and Masaccio, were
not of less account for genius and noble work than any ancient artist of
great fame.&quot; After some remarks upon industry and the advantages of
scientific theory, he proceeds: &quot;Who is there so hard and envious of
temper as not to praise the architect Filippo, when he saw so vast a
structure, raised above the heavens, spacious enough to cover with its
shadow all the Tuscan folks, built without any aid from beams and
scaffoldings, a miracle of art, if I judge rightly, which might in this
age have been deemed impossible, and which even among the ancients was
perhaps unknown, undreamed of?&quot; After this exordium, he commits to
Brunelleschi's care his little book on painting, <i>quale a tuo nome feci
in lingua toscana</i>. The interest of this dedication lies not only in the
mention of the five chief <i>quattrocento</i> artists by Alberti, and in the
record of the impression first produced on him by Florence, but also in
the recognition that, great as were the dead arts of antiquity, the
modern arts of Italy could rival them. It is an intuition parallel to
that which induced Alberti to compose the <i>Famiglia</i> in Italian, and
proves that he could endure the blaze of humanism without blindness.</p>

<p>In the fourth group of Alberti's prose-works we come across a new vein
of semi-moral, semi-satirical reflection. These are devoted to love and
matrimony, giving rhetorical expression to the misogynistic side of the
<i>Novelle</i>. Alberti professes himself a master in the lore of love. He
knows its symptoms, diagnoses and describes the stages of the malady,
and pretends to intimate acquaintance with the foibles of both sexes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">-210-</a></span>
Yet we seem to feel that his knowledge is rather literary than real,
derived from books and pranked with a scholastic show of borrowed
learning. Two lectures addressed by women to their own sex on the art of
love, take the first place in this series. The one is called
<i>Ecatomfila</i>, or the lady of the hundred loves; the other <i>Amiria</i>, or
the lady of the myriad.<a name="FNanchor_258_259" id="FNanchor_258_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_259" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The former tells her female audience what
kind of lover to choose, neither too young nor too old, not too rich nor
yet too handsome; how to keep him, and in what way to make the most of
the precious acquisition. She is comparatively modest, and the sort of
passion she implies may pass for virtuous. Yet her large experience of
men proves she has arrived at wisdom after many trials. Her virtue is a
matter of prudent egoism. Amiria takes a different line. Heliogabalus
might have used her precepts in his <i>Concio ad Meretrices</i>. Her
discourse turns upon the subsidiary aids to beauty and the arts of
coquetry. Recipes for hair-dyes, depilatories, eye-lotions,
tooth-powders, soaps, lip-salves, ointments, cosmetics, skin-preservers,
wart-destroyers, pearl-powders, rouges, are followed up with sound
advice about craft, fraud, force, feigned passion, entangling
man&#339;uvres, crocodile tears, and secrecy in self-indulgence. The
sustained irony of this address, and the minute acquaintance with the
least laudable secrets of an Italian lady's toilet it reveals, place it
upon the list of literary curiosities. Did any human beings ever plaster
their faces with such stuff as Amiria gravely recommends?<a name="FNanchor_259_260" id="FNanchor_259_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_260" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">-211-</a></span></p><p>The <i>Deifira</i> is a dialogue on the cure of a distempered passion, which
adds but little to Ovid's <i>Remedium Amoris</i>; while two short treatises
on marriage only prove that Alberti took the old Simonidean view of
there being at least nine bad women to one good one.<a name="FNanchor_260_261" id="FNanchor_260_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_261" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> His misogyny,
whether real or affected, reaches its climax in an epistle to Paolo
Codagnello, which combines the worst things said by Boccaccio in the
<i>Corbaccio</i> with Lucian's satire on female uncleanliness in the
<i>Amores</i>.<a name="FNanchor_261_262" id="FNanchor_261_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_262" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> The tirade appears to be as serious as possible, and,
indeed, Alberti's generalities might be illustrated <i>ad libitum</i> from
the <i>Novelle</i>. It is no wonder that women resented his treatment of
them; and one of his most amusing lesser tracts is a dialogue between
himself and a lady called Sofrona, who took him to task for this very
epistle. In answer to her reproaches he is ceremoniously polite. He also
gives her the last word in the argument, not without a stroke of humor.
&quot;It is all very well of you, men of letters, to take our characters
away, so long as we can rule our husbands and make choice of lovers when
and how we choose. All you men run after us; and if you do but see a
pretty girl, you <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">-212-</a></span>stand as stock still as a statue.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_262_263" id="FNanchor_262_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_263" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> After this
fashion runs Sofrona's reply.</p>

<p>Alberti's misogynistic essays remind us how very difficult it is to
understand or explain the tone of popular literature in that century
with regard to women. That the <i>Novelle</i> were written to amuse both
sexes seems clear; and we must imagine that the women who read so much
vituperation of their manners, regarded it as a conventional play with
words. Like Sofrona, they knew their satirists to be fair husbands,
fathers, brothers, and, in the capacity of lovers, ludicrously blind to
their defects. The current abuse of women, in which Petrarch no less
than Alberti and Boccaccio indulged, seems to have been a scholastic
survival of the coarse and ignorant literature of the medieval clergy.
Cloistered monks indulged their taste for obscenity, and indemnified
themselves for self-imposed celibacy, by grossly insulting the mothers
who bore them and the institution they administered as a sacrament.<a name="FNanchor_263_264" id="FNanchor_263_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_264" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
Their invective tickled the vulgar ear, and passed into popular
literature, where it held its own as a commonplace, not credited with
too much meaning by folk who knew the world.</p>

<p>The pretty story of Ippolito and Leonora, could we believe it to be
Alberti's, might pass for a palinode to these misogynistic
treatises.<a name="FNanchor_264_265" id="FNanchor_264_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_265" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> It is the tale of two Florentine lovers, born in hostile
houses, and brought after a series of misadventures, to the fruition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">-213-</a></span>honorable love in marriage. The legend must have been very popular.
Besides the prose version, in which the lovers are called Ippolito de'
Buondelmonti and Leonora de' Bardi, we have a poem in <i>ottava rima</i>,
where the heroine's name becomes Dianora. A Latin translation of the
same novel was produced by Paolo Cortesi, with the title <i>Hyppolyti et
Deyanir&#230; Historia</i>. But since Alberti's authorship has not been clearly
proved, it is more prudent to class both Italian versions among those
anonymous products of popular literature which will form the topic of my
next <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">chapter</a>.</p>

<p>Of Alberti's poems few survive; and these have no great literary value.
Out of the three serious sonnets, one beginning <i>Io vidi gi&#224; seder</i>
deserves to be studied for a certain rapidity of movement and mystery of
emotion.<a name="FNanchor_265_266" id="FNanchor_265_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_266" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> It might be compared to an allegorical engraving by some
artist of the sixteenth century&#8212;Robeta or the Master of the Caduceus.
Two burlesque sonnets in reply to Burchiello have this interest, that
they illustrate a point of literary contact between the people and the
cultivated classes. But, on the whole, the Sestines and the Elegy of
Agiletta must be reckoned Alberti's best performances in verse.<a name="FNanchor_266_267" id="FNanchor_266_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_267" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
Here his gnomic wisdom finds expression in pregnant, almost epigrammatic
utterances. There are passages in the <i>Agiletta</i>, weighty with packed
sentences, which remind an English reader of Bacon's lines on human
life.<a name="FNanchor_267_268" id="FNanchor_267_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_268" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Still it is the poetry of a man largely gifted, but not born
to be a singer. It may be worth <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">-214-</a></span>adding to this brief notice of
Alberti's rhymes, that he essayed Latin meters in Italian. The following
elegiac couplet belongs to him<a name="FNanchor_268_269" id="FNanchor_268_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_269" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
Questa per estremo miserabile epistola mando<br />
<span class="ind1">A te che spregi miseramente noi.</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It is not worth printing. But it illustrates that endeavor to fuse the
forms of ancient with the material of modern art, which underlay
Alberti's practical experiments in architecture.</p>

<p>It may seem that too much attention has already been given to Alberti
and his works. Yet when we consider his peculiar position in the history
of the Renaissance, when we remember the singular beauty of his
character, and reflect that, first among the humanists of mark, he
deigned to labor for the public and to cultivate his mother tongue, a
certain disproportion in the space allotted him may be excused. What his
immediate successors in the field of erudition thought of him, can be
gathered from a passage in Poliziano's preface to the first edition of
his work on Architecture.<a name="FNanchor_269_270" id="FNanchor_269_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_270" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> &quot;To praise the author is beyond the
narrow limits of a letter, beyond the poor reach of my powers of
eloquence. Nothing, however abstruse in learning, however remote from
the ordinary range of scholarship, was hidden from his genius. One might
question whether he was better fitted for oratory or for poetry, whether
his speech was the more weighty or the more polished.&quot; These great
qualities Alberti <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">-215-</a></span>placed freely at the service of the unlettered laity.
He is therefore the hero of that age which I have called the period of
transition.</p>

<p>In Alberti, moreover, we study the best type of the Italian intellect as
it was molded, on emergence from the middle ages, by those double
influences of humanism and fine art which determined the Renaissance.
Though his genius was rather artistic than scientific, all problems of
nature and of man attracted him; and he dealt freely with them in the
spirit of true modern curiosity. His method shows no trace either of
mystical theology or of crooked scholasticism. He surveyed the world
with a meditative but observant glance, avoiding the deeper questions of
ontology, and depicting what he noticed with the realism of a painter.
This powerful pictorial faculty made his sketches from contemporary
life&#8212;the description of the gambler in the <i>Deiciarchia</i>; the portrait
of the sage in the <i>Teogenio</i>; the domestic colloquies of Giannozzo with
his wife in the <i>Famiglia</i>; the interior of a coquette's chamber in the
<i>Amiria</i>&#8212;surprising for sincerity and fullness. As a writer, he has the
same merit that we recognize in Masaccio and Ghirlandajo among the
fresco-painters of that age. But Alberti's touch is more sympathetic,
his humanity more loving.</p>

<p>He was not eminent as a metaphysician. From Plato he only borrowed
something of his literary art, and something of ethical elevation,
leaving to Ficino the mysticism which then passed for Platonic science.
His ideal of the virtuous man is a Florence burgher, honorable but keen
in business, open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">-216-</a></span> to culture of all kinds, untainted by the cynicism
that marred Cosimo de' Medici, lacking the licentious traits of the
<i>Novelle</i>. Alberti's Padre di Famiglia might have stepped from the walls
of the Riccardi Chapel or the Choir of S. Maria Novella, in his grave
red <i>lucco</i>, with the cold and powerful features. The life praised above
all others by Alberti is the life of a meditative student, withdrawn
from State affairs, and corresponding with men of a like tranquil
nature. This ideal was realized by Sannazzaro in his Mergellina, by
Ficino at Montevecchio, by Pico at Querceto. Just as his science and his
philosophy were &#230;sthetic, so were his religion and his morality. He
conformed to the ceremonies of the Catholic Church. But the religious
sentiment had already become in him rational rather than emotional, and
less a condition of the conscience than of the artistic sensibility.
Honor in men, honesty in women, moved his admiration because they are
comely. The splendor of the stars, the loveliness of earth, raised him
in thought to the supreme source of beauty. Whatever the genius of man
brings to perfection of grace, he called divine, realizing for the first
time the piety that finds God in the human spirit.<a name="FNanchor_270_271" id="FNanchor_270_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_271" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>The harmonious lines and the vast spaces of the Florentine Duomo
thrilled him like music, merging the charm of art in the high worship of
a cultivated nature. &quot;This temple,&quot; he writes in a passage that might be
quoted as the quintessential exposition of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">-217-</a></span> mind,<a name="FNanchor_271_272" id="FNanchor_271_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_272" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> &quot;has in it
both grace and majesty, and I delight to notice that union of slender
elegance with full and vigorous solidity, which shows that while every
member is designed to please, the whole is built for perpetuity. Inside
these aisles there is the climate of eternal spring&#8212;wind, frost, and
rime without; a quiet and mild air within&#8212;the blaze of summer on the
square; delicious coolness here. Above all things I delight in feeling
the sweetness of those voices busied at the sacrifice, and in the sacred
rites our classic ancestors called mysteries. All other modes and kinds
of singing weary with reiteration; only religious music never palls. I
know not how others are affected; but for myself, those hymns and psalms
of the Church produce on me the very effect for which they were
designed, soothing all disturbance of the soul, and inspiring a certain
ineffable languor full of reverence toward God. What heart of man is so
rude as not to be softened when he hears the rhythmic rise and fall of
those voices, complete and true, in cadences so sweet and flexible? I
assure you that I never listen in these mysteries and funeral ceremonies
to the Greek words which call on God for aid against our human
wretchedness, without weeping. Then, too, I ponder what power music
brings with it to soften us and soothe.&quot;</p>

<p>It would be difficult with greater spontaneity and truth to delineate
the emotions stirred in an artistic nature by the services of a
cathedral. It is the language, however, not of a devout Christian, but
one who, long before Goethe, had realized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">-218-</a></span> Goethesque ideal of
&quot;living with fixed purpose in the Whole, the Good, the Beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>Alberti both in his width of genius and in his limitations&#8212;in his
all-embracing curiosity and aptitude for knowledge, his sensitiveness to
every charm, his strong practical bias, the realism of his pictures, the
objectivity of his style, his indifference to theology and metaphysic,
the largeness of his love for all things that have grace, the
substitution of &#230;sthetical for moral standards, the purity of his taste,
the tranquillity and urbanity of his spirit, his Stoic-Epicurean
acceptance of the world where man may be content to dwell and build
himself a home of beauty&#8212;was a true representative of his age. What
attracts us in the bronze-work of Ghiberti, in the bass-reliefs of Della
Robbia, in Rossellino's sleeping Cardinal di Portogallo, in
Ghirlandajo's portraits and the airy space of Masaccio's backgrounds, in
the lives of Ficino and Pomponio Leto, in the dome of Brunelleschi, in
the stanzas of Poliziano, arrives at consciousness in Alberti, pervades
his writing, and finds unique expression in the fragment of his Latin
biography. Yet we must not measure the age of Cosimo de' Medici and
Roderigo Borgia by the standard of Alberti. He presents the spirit of
the fifteenth century at its very best. Philosophical and artistic
sympathy compensate in his religion for that period's lack of pious
faith. Its political degradation assumes in him the shape of a
fastidious retirement from vulgar strife. Its lawlessness, caprice, and
violence are regulated by the motto &quot;Nothing overmuch&quot; which forms the
keystone of his ethics. Its realism is tempered by his love for man and
beast and tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">-219-</a></span>&#8212;that love which made him weep when he beheld the summer
fields and labors of the husbandman. Its sensuality finds no place in
his harmonious nature. Many defects of the century are visible enough in
Alberti; but what redeemed Italy from corruption and rendered her
capable of great and brilliant work amid the chaos of States ruining in
infidelity and vice&#8212;that free energy of the intellect, open to all
influences, inventive of ideas, creative of beauty, which ennobled her
Renaissance&#8212;burned in him with mild and tranquil radiance.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the fittest place to notice a remarkable book, which,
though it cannot be reckoned among the masterpieces of Italian
literature, is too important in its bearing on the history of the
Renaissance to be passed in silence. The <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i>, or
&quot;Poliphil's Strife of Love in a Dream,&quot; was written by Francesco
Colonna, a Dominican monk, at Treviso in 1467.<a name="FNanchor_272_273" id="FNanchor_272_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_273" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> There is some reason
to conjecture that he composed it first in Latin;<a name="FNanchor_273_274" id="FNanchor_273_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_274" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> but when it
appeared in print in 1499, it had already assumed the garb of a strange
maccaronic style, blending the euphuisms of affected rhetoric with
phrases culled from humanistic pedantry. The base of the language
professes to be Italian; but it is an Italian Latinized in all its
elements, and interlarded with scraps of Greek and Hebrew. The following

of its peculiar dialect<a name="FNanchor_274_275" id="FNanchor_274_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_275" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>:</p>

<p>Whether Francesco Colonna prepared the redaction from which this
paragraph is quoted, admits of doubt. A scholar, Leonardo Crasso of
Verona, defrayed the cost of the edition. Manutius Aldus printed the
volume and its pages were adorned with precious wood-cuts, the work of
more than one anonymous master of the Lombardo-Venetian school.<a name="FNanchor_275_276" id="FNanchor_275_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_276" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> It
was dedicated to Duke Guidobaldo of Urbino.</p>

<p>For the student of Italian literature in its transition from the middle
age to the Renaissance, the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i> has special and many-sided
interest. It shows that outside Florence, where the pure Italian idiom
was too vigorous to be suppressed, humanistic fashion had so far taken
possession of the literary fancy as to threaten the very existence of
the mother tongue. But, more than this, it represents that epoch of
transition in its fourfold intellectual craving after the beauty of
antiquity, the treasures of erudition, the multiplied delights of art,
and the liberty of nature. These cravings are allegorized in a romance
of love, which blends medieval mysticism with modern sensuousness. Like
the style, the matter of the book is maccaronic, parti-colored and
confused; but the passion which controls so many elements is genuine and
simple. The spirit of the earlier Renaissance reflects itself, as in a
mirror, in the Dream of Poliphil. So essentially is it the product of a
transitional moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">-222-</a></span> that when the first enthusiasm for its euphuistic
pedantry and &#230;sthetical rapture had subsided, the key to its most
obvious meaning was lost. In the preface to the fourth French edition
(1600), Beroald de Verville hinted that the volume held deep alchemistic
secrets for those who could discover them. After this distortion the
book passed into not altogether unmerited oblivion. It had done its work
for the past age. It now remains an invaluable monument for those who
would fain reconstruct the century which gave it birth.</p>

<p>The <i>Hypnerotomachia</i> professes to relate its author's love for Polia, a
nun, his search after her, and their union, at the close of sundry
trials and adventures, in the realm of Venus. Poliphil dreams that he
finds himself in a wild wood, where he is assailed by monstrous beasts,
and suffers great distress of mind. He prays to Diespiter, and comes
forthwith into a pleasant valley, through which he wanders in the hope
of finding Polia. At the outset of his journey he meets five damsels,
Aphea, Offressia, Orassia, Achoe, Geussia, who conduct him to their
queen, Eleuterilyda.<a name="FNanchor_276_277" id="FNanchor_276_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_277" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> She understands his quest, and assigns the
maidens, Logistica and Thelemia, to be his guides into the palace of
Telosia. They journey together and arrive at the abode of Dame Telosia,
which has three gates severally inscribed in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin
characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">-223-</a></span> with legends, the meaning whereof is God's Glory, Mother of
Love, and Worldly Glory. Poliphil enters the first door, and finds the
place within but little to his liking. Then he tries the third, and is
no better pleased. Lastly he gains admittance to the demesne of Love's
Mother, where he is content to Stay. Lovely and lascivious maidens greet
him kindly; and while he surrenders to their invitation, one of his
attendants, Logistica, takes her flight. He is left with his beloved
Thelemia to enjoy the pleasures of this enchanting region.</p>

<p>Thus far the allegory is not hard to read. Poliphil, or the lover of
Polia, escapes from the perils of the forest where his earlier life was
passed, by petition to the Father of Gods and Men. He places himself in
the hands of the five senses, who conduct him to freewill. Freewill
appoints for his further guidance reason and inclination, who are to
lead him to the final choice of lives. When he arrives at the point
where this choice has to be made, he perceives that God, the world, and
beauty, who is mother of love, compete for his willing service. He
rejects religion and ambition; and no sooner has his preference for love
and beauty been avowed, than the reasoning faculty deserts him, and he
is abandoned to inclination.</p>

<p>While Poliphil is dallying with the nymphs of pleasure and his own
wanton will, he is suddenly abandoned by these companions, and pursues
his journey alone.<a name="FNanchor_277_278" id="FNanchor_277_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_278" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Before long, however, he becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">-224-</a></span> aware of a
maiden, exceedingly fair to look upon, who carries in her hand a lighted
torch. With her for guide, he passes through many pleasant places,
arriving finally at the temple of Venus Physizoe. This maiden, though as
yet he cannot recognize her, is the Polia he seeks, and on their way
together he feels the influences of her love-compelling beauty. They
enter the chapel of Venus, and are graciously received by the prioress
who guards that sanctuary. Mystical rites of initiation and consecration
are performed. Polia lays down her torch, and is discovered by her
lover. Then they are wedded by grace of the abiding goddess; and having
undergone the ceremony of spousal, they resume their wanderings
together. They pass through a desolate city of tombs and ruins, named
Polyandrion, where are the sepulchers and epitaphs of lovers. Here, too,
they witness the pangs of souls tormented for their crimes against the
deity of Love. Afterwards they reach a great water, where Cupid's barge
comes sailing by, and takes them to the island of Cythera. It is a level
land of gardens, groves and labyrinths, adorned with theaters and baths,
and watered by a mystic font of Venus. Near the Tomb of Adonis in this
demesne of Love, Polia and Poliphil sit down to rest among the nymphs,
and Polia relates the story of their early passion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">-225-</a></span></p>

<p>It is here, if anywhere, that we come across reality in this romance.
Polia tells how the town of Treviso was founded, and of what illustrious
lineage she came, and how she vowed herself to the service of Diana when
the plague was raging in the city. In Dian's temple Poliphil first saw
her, and fainted at the sight, and she, made cruel by the memory of her
vows, left him upon the temple-floor for dead. But when she returned
home, a vision of women punished for their hard heart smote her
conscience; and her old nurse, an adept in the ways of love, counseled
her to seek the Prioress of Venus, and confess, and enter into
reconcilement with her lover. What the nurse advised, Polia did, and in
the temple of Venus she met Poliphil. He, while his body lay entranced
upon the floor of Dian's church, had visited the heavens in spirit and
obtained grace from Venus and Cupid. Therefore, the twain were now of
one accord, and ready to be joined in bonds of natural affection. At the
end of Polia's story, the nymphs leave both lovers to enjoy their
new-found happiness. But here the power of sleep is spent, and Poliphil,
awakened by the song of swallows, starts from dreams with &quot;Farewell, my
Polia!&quot; upon his lips.</p>

<p>Such is the frail and slender basis of romance, corresponding, in the
details of Polia's narrative, to an ordinary <i>novella</i>, upon which the
bulky edifice of the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i> is built. This love-story, while
it gives form to the book, is clearly not the author's main motive. What
really concerns him most deeply is the handling of artistic themes,
which, though introduced by way of digressions, occupy by far the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">-226-</a></span>
larger portion of his work. The <i>Hypnerotomachia</i> is an encyclop&#230;dia of
curious learning, a treasure-house of &#230;sthetical descriptions and
discussions, vividly reflecting the two ruling enthusiasms of the
earlier Renaissance for scholarship and art. Minute details of
inexhaustible variety, bringing before our imagination the architecture,
sculpture, and painting of the fifteenth century, its gardens, palaces
and temples, its processions, triumphs and ceremonial shows, its delight
in costly jewels, furniture, embroidery and banquets, its profound
feeling for the beauty of women, and its admiration for the goodliness
of athletic manhood, are massed together with bewildering profusion. Not
one of the technical arts which flourished in the dawn of the
Renaissance but finds due celebration here; and the whole is penetrated
with that fervent reverence for antiquity which inspired the humanists.
Yet the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i>, though sometimes tedious, is never frigid.
With the precision of a treatise and the minuteness of an inventory, it
combines the ardor of impassioned feeling, the rapture of anticipation,
the artist's blending with the lover's ecstasy. It is a dithyramb of the
imagination, inflamed by no Oriental lust of mere magnificence, but by
the fine sense of what is beautiful in form, rare in material, just in
proportion, exquisite in workmanship.</p>

<p>Whether the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i> exercised a powerful influence over the
productions of the Italian genius, can be doubted. But that it presents
an epitome or figured abstract of the Renaissance in its earlier
luxuriance, is unmistakable. Reading it, we wander through the
collections of Paul II., rich with jewels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">-227-</a></span> <i>intagli</i>, cameos and coins;
we enter Amadeo's chapels, Filarete's palaces, Bramante's peristyles and
<i>loggie</i>; we pace the gardens of the Brenta and the Sforza's deer-parks
at Pavia; we watch Lorenzo's Florentine <i>trionfi</i> and Pietro Riario's
festivals in Rome; Giorgione's <i>f&#234;tes champ&#234;tres</i> are set for us in
framework of the choicest fruits and flowers; we hear Ciriac of Ancona
discoursing on his epigraphs and broken marbles; before our eyes, as in
a gallery, are ranged the bass-reliefs of Donatello wrought in bronze,
Mantegna's triumphs, Signorelli's arabesques, the terra-cotta of the
Lombard and the stucco of the Roman schools, the carved-work of
Alberti's church at Rimini, the <i>tarsiatura</i> of Fra Giovanni da Verona's
choir-stalls, doorways from Milanese and chimneys from Urbino palaces,
Vatican tapestries and trellis-work of beaten iron from Prato&#8212;all that
the Renaissance in its bloom produced, is here depicted with the wealth
and warmth of fancy doting on anticipated beauties.</p>

<p>Of the author, Francesco Colonna, very little is known, except that he
was born in 1433 at Venice, that he attached himself to Ermolao Barbaro,
spent a portion of his manhood in the Dominican cloister of S. Niccol&#242;
at Treviso, and died at Venice in 1527. Whether the love-tale of the
<i>Hypnerotomachia</i> had a basis of reality, or whether we ought to regard
it wholly from the point of view of allegory, cannot be decided now. It
is, however, probable that a substratum of experience underlay the vast
mass of superimposed erudition and enthusiastic reverie. The references
to Polia's name and race; her epitaph appended to the first edition; the
details of her narra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">-228-</a></span>tive, which somewhat break the continuity of style
and introduce a biographical element into the romance; the very
structure of the allegory which assigns so large a part in life to
sensuous instinct&#8212;all these points seem to prove that Poliphil was
moved by memory of what had really happened, no less than by the desire
to express a certain mood of feeling and belief. Such mingling of actual
emotion with ideal passion in a work of imagination, dedicated to a
woman who is also an emblem, was consistent with the practice of
medieval poets. Polia belongs, under altered circumstances, to the same
class as Beatrice. The hypothesis that, whoever she may have been, she
had become for her lover a metaphor of antique beauty, is sufficiently
attractive and plausible. If we adopt this theory, we must interpret the
dark wood where Poliphil first found himself, to mean the anarchy of
Gothic art; while his emancipation through the senses and Thelemia
characterizes the spirit in which the Italians achieved the Revival. The
extraordinary care lavished upon details, interrupting the course of the
romance and withdrawing our sympathy from Polia, meet from this point of
view with justification. Veiling his enthusiasm for the renascent past
beneath the fiction of a novel, Francesco Colonna invests the lady of
his intellectual choice, the handmaid of Aphrodite, evoked from the
sepulcher where arts and sciences lie buried, with rich Renaissance
trappings of elaborate device. Beneath those exuberant arabesques,
within that labyrinth of technically perfect details, suave outlines,
delicate contours devoid of content, a real woman would be lost. But if
Polia be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">-229-</a></span> not merely a woman, if she be, as her name <span lang="el" title="Greek: polia">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#945;</span>
seems to indicate, at the same time the vision of resurgent classic
beauty, then the setting which her lover has contrived is adequate to
the influences which inspired him. The multiform and labored frame-work
of his picture acquires a meaning from the spirit of the goddess whom he
worships, and the presiding genius of his age dwells in a shrine, each
point of which is brilliant with the splendor which that spirit
radiates.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, as an allegory of the Renaissance, conscious of its
destiny and strongest aspirations in the person of an almost nameless
monk, that we should read the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i>. Still, even so, the
mark of indecision, which rests upon the many twy-formed masterpieces of
this century, is here discernible. Francesco Colonna has one foot in the
middle ages, another planted on the firm ground of the modern era. He
wavers between the psychological realism of romance and the
philosophical idealism of allegory. Polia is both too much and too
little of a woman. At one time her personality seems as distinct as that
of any heroine of fiction; at another we lose sight of her in the mist
of symbolism. Granting, again, that she is a metaphor, she lends herself
to more than one conception. She is both an emblem of passion,
sanctified by nature, and liberated from the bondage of asceticism, and
also an emblem of ideal beauty, recovered from the past, and worshiped
by a scholar-artist.</p>

<p>This confusion of motives and uncertainty of aim, while it detracts from
the artistic value of the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i>, enhances its historical
importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">-230-</a></span> In form, the book has to be classed with the Visions of the
middle ages&#8212;the Divine Comedy, the <i>Amorosa Visione</i>, and the
<i>Quadriregio</i>. But though the form is medieval, the inspiration of this
prose-poem is quite other. We have seen already how Francesco Colonna,
traveling in search of Polia, prayed to Jupiter, and how the senses and
freewill guided him to the satisfaction of his deepest self in the
service of Beauty. It is in the temple of Venus Physizoe (Venus the
procreative source of life in Nature) that he meets with his love and is
wedded to her in the bonds of mutual desire.<a name="FNanchor_278_279" id="FNanchor_278_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_279" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Christianity is
wholly, we might say systematically, ignored. The ascetic standpoint of
the middle age is abandoned for another, antagonistic to its ruling
impulses. A new creed, a new cult, are introduced. Polia, whether we
regard her as the poet's mistress or as the spirit of antiquity which
has enamored him, is won by worship paid to deities of natural appetite.
In its essence, then, the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i> corresponds to the most
fruitful instinct of the Renaissance&#8212;to that striving after
emancipation which restored humanity to its heritage in the realms of
sense and reason. Old ideals, exhausted and devoid of vital force, are
exchanged for fresh and beautiful reality. The spirituality of the past,
which has become consumptive and ineffectively lapse of time and long
familiarity, yields to vigorous animalism. The cloister is quitted for
the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">-231-</a></span> religious for artistic ecstasy, celestial for earthly
paradise, scholasticism for humane studies, the ascetic for the
hedonistic rule of conduct. Criticised according to its deeper meaning,
the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i> is the poem of which Valla's <i>De Voluptate</i> was
the argument, of which Lorenzo de' Medici's life was the realization,
and the life of Aretino the caricature. If it assumes the form of a
vision, reminding us thereby that the author was born upon the confines
of the middle ages and the modern era, it deals with the vision in no
Dantesque spirit, but with the geniality of Apuleius. Allegory is but a
transparent veil, to make the nudity of natural impulse fascinating. As
in Boccaccio, so here the hymn of <i>il talento</i>, simple appetite, is
sung; but the fusion of artistic and humanistic enthusiasms with this
ground-motive adds peculiar quality, distinctive of the later age which
gave it birth.</p>

<p>The secret of its charm, which, indeed, it shares with earlier
Renaissance art in general, is that this yearning after freedom has been
felt with rapture, but not fully satisfied. The season of repletion and
satiety is distant. Venus Physizoe appears to Francesco Colonna radiant
above all powers of heaven or earth, because he is a monk and may not
serve her. Had he his whole will, she might have been for him Venus
Volgivaga, and he the author of another <i>Puttana Errante</i>. Nor has she
yet assumed the earnest mask of science. This element of unassuaged
desire, indulged in longings and outgoings of the fancy, this
recognition of man's highest good and happiness in nature by one who has
forsworn allegiance to the laws of nature, adds warmth to his emotion
and pene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">-232-</a></span>trates his pictures with a kind of passion. The arts and
scholarship, which divide the empire of his soul with beauty, have no
less attraction of romance than love itself. Nor are they separated in
his mind from nature. Nature and antiquity, knowledge and desire, the
reverence for abstract beauty and the instincts of a lover are fused in
one enthusiasm. Thus Francesco Colonna makes us understand how Italy
used both art and erudition as instruments in the liberation of human
energies. For the thinkers and actors of that period, antiquity and the
plastic arts were aids to the recovery of a paradise from which man had
been exiled. They could not dissociate the conception of nature from
studies which revealed their human dignity and freedom, or from arts
whereby they expressed their vivid sense of beauty. The work they thus
inaugurated, had afterwards to be continued by the scientific faculties.</p>

<p>One word may finally be said about the peculiar delicacy of this book.
The <i>Hypnerotomachia</i> is no less an apotheosis of natural appetite than
the <i>Amorosa Visione</i>. But it is more sentimental and imaginative,
because its author had not Boccaccio's crude experience. It anticipates
the art of the great age&#8212;the art of Cellini and Giulio Romano,
goldsmith-sculptors and palace-builders; but it is more refined and
passionate, because its author enjoyed those beauties of consummate
craft in reverie instead of practice. It interprets the enthusiasm of
Ciriac and Poggio, discoverers of manuscripts, decipherers of epigraphs;
but it is more <i>na&#239;f</i> and graceful than their work of erudition, because
its author dealt freely with his learning and subordinated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">-233-</a></span> scholarship
to fancy. In short the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i> is a foreshadowing of the
Renaissance in its prime&#8212;the spirit of the age foreseen in dreams,
embodied in imagination, purged of material alloy, and freed from the
encumbrances of actuality.</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">During</span> the fifteenth century there was an almost complete separation
between the cultivated classes and the people. Humanists, intent upon
the exploration of the classics, deemed it below their dignity to use
the vulgar tongue. They thought and wrote in Latin, and had no time to
bestow upon the education of the common folk. A polite public was
formed, who in the Courts of princes and the palaces of noblemen amused
themselves with the ephemeral literature of pamphlets, essays, and
epistles in the Latin tongue. For these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">-235-</a></span> well-educated readers Poggio
and Pontano wrote their Latin novels. The same learned audience
applauded the gladiators of the moment, Valla and Filelfo, when they
descended into the arena and plied each other with pseudo-Ciceronian
invectives. To quit this refined circle, and address the vulgar crowd,
was thought unworthy of a man of erudition. Even Alberti, as we have
seen, felt bound to apologize for sending his <i>Teogenio</i> in Italian to
Lionello d'Este. Only here and there a humanist of the first rank is
found who, like Bruni, devoted a portion of his industry to the Italian
lives of Dante and Petrarch, or like Filelfo, lectured on the Divine
Comedy, or again like Landino, composed a Dantesque commentary in the
mother tongue. Moreover, Dante and Petrarch passed for almost classical;
and in nearly all such instances of condescension, pecuniary interest
swayed the scholar from his wonted orbit. It was want of skill in Latin
rather than love for his own idiom which induced Vespasiano to pen his
lives of great men in Italian. Not spontaneous inspiration, but the whim
of a ducal patron forced Filelfo to use <i>terza rima</i> for his worthless
poem on S. John, and to write a commentary upon Petrarch in the
vernacular.<a name="FNanchor_279_280" id="FNanchor_279_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_280" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> One of this man's letters reveals the humanist's
contempt for the people's language, and his rooted belief in the
immortality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">-236-</a></span> Latin. It is worth translating.<a name="FNanchor_280_281" id="FNanchor_280_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_281" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> &quot;I will answer
you,&quot; he says, &quot;not in the vulgar language, as you ask, but in Latin and
our own true speech; for I have ever had an abhorrence for the talk of
grooms and servants, equal to my detestation of their life and manners.
You, however, call that dialect vernacular which, when I use the Tuscan
tongue, I sometimes write. All Italians agree in praise of Tuscan. Yet I
only employ it for such matters as I do not choose to transmit to
posterity. Moreover, even that Tuscan idiom is hardly current throughout
Italy, while Latin is far and wide diffused throughout the habitable
world.&quot; From this interesting epistle we gather that even professional
scholars in the middle of the fifteenth century recognized Tuscan as a
quasi-literary language, superior in polish to the other Italian
dialects, but not to be compared for dignity and durability with Latin.
It also proves that the language of Boccaccio was for them almost a
foreign speech.</p>

<p>This attitude of learned writers produced a curious obtuseness of
critical insight. Niccol&#242; Niccoli, though he was a Florentine, called
Dante &quot;a poet for bakers and cobblers.&quot; Pico della Mirandola preferred
Lorenzo de' Medici's verses to Petrarch. Landino complained, not,
indeed, without good reason in that century, that the vulgar language
could boast of no great authors. Filippo Villani, in the proem to his
biographies, apologized for his father Matteo, who exerted humble
faculties and scanty culture to his best ability. Lorenzo de' Medici
defended himself for paying attention to an idiom which men of good
judgment blamed for &quot;low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">-237-</a></span>ness, incapacity and unworthiness to deal with
high themes or grave material.&quot; Benedetto Varchi, who lived to be an
excellent though somewhat cumbrous writer of Italian prose, gives this
account of his early training<a name="FNanchor_281_282" id="FNanchor_281_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_282" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>: &quot;I remember that when I was a lad,
the first and strictest rule of a father to his sons, and of a master to
his pupils, was that they should on no account and for no object read
anything in the vulgar speech (<i>non legesseno cose volgari, per dirlo
barbaramente come loro</i>); and Master Guasparre Mariscotti da Marradi,
who was my teacher in grammar, a man of hard and rough but pure and
excellent manners, having once heard, I know not how, that Schiatta di
Bernardo Bagnesi and I were wont to read Petrarch on the sly, gave as a
sound rating for it, and nearly expelled us from his school.&quot; Some of
Varchi's own stylistic pedantries may be attributed to this Latinizing
education.</p>

<p>Even when they wrote their mother tongue, it followed that the men of
humanistic culture had a false conception of style. Alberti could not
abstain from Latinistic rhetoric. Cristoforo Landino went the length of
asserting that &quot;he who would fain be a good Tuscan writer, must first be
a Latin scholar.&quot; The Italian of familiar correspondence was mingled in
almost equal quantities with Latin phrases. Thus Poliziano, writing from
Venice to Lorenzo de' Medici, employs the following strange maccaronic
jargon<a name="FNanchor_282_283" id="FNanchor_282_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_283" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Visitai stamattina Messer Zaccheria Barbero; e mostrandoli io
l'affezione vostra ec., mi rispose sempre lagrimando, et ut
visum est, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">-238-</a></span>de cuore; risolvendosi in questo, in te uno spem
esse. Ostendit so nosse quantum tibi debeat; sicch&#232; fate
quello ragionaste, ut favens ad majora. Quello Legato che
torna da Roma, et qui tecum locutus est Florenti&#230;, non &#232; punto
a loro proposito, ut ajunt.</p>
</div>

<p>Poliziano, however, showed by his letters to the ladies of the Medicean
family, and by some sermons composed for a religious brotherhood of
which he was a member, that he had no difficulty in writing Tuscan prose
of the best quality.<a name="FNanchor_283_284" id="FNanchor_283_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_284" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> It seems to have been a contemptuous fashion
among men of learning, when they used the mother tongue for
correspondence, to load it with Latin&#8212;just as a German of the age of
Frederick proved his superiority by French phrases. The acme of this
affectation was reached in the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i>, where the vice of
Latinism sought perpetuation through the printing press. Meanwhile, the
genius of the Florentine people was saving Italian literature from the
extreme consequences to which caricatures of this kind, inspired by
humanistic pedantry and sciolism, exposed it.</p>

<p>A characteristic incident of the year 1441 brings before us a set of men
who, though obscure and devoted to the service of the common folk,
exercised no slight influence over the destinies of the Italian
language. After the reinstatement of the Medici, and while Alberti was
resident in Florence, it occurred to him to propose the prize of a
silver crown for the best poem upon Friendship, in the vulgar tongue.
Piero de' Medici approving of this scheme, it was arranged that the
contest for the prize should take place in S. Maria del Fiore, the
competitors reciting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">-239-</a></span> their own compositions. The secretaries of Pope
Eugenius IV. consented to be umpires. Eight poets entered the
lists&#8212;Michele di Noferi del Gigante, Francesco d'Altobianco degli
Alberti, and six others not less unknown to fame. We still possess their
compositions in octave stanzas, <i>terza rima</i>, sapphics, hexameters and
lyric strophes.<a name="FNanchor_284_285" id="FNanchor_284_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_285" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> The poems were so bad that even the judges of that
period refused to award the crown; nor could the most indulgent student
of forgotten literature arraign this verdict for severity. Yet the men
who engaged in Alberti's <i>Certamen Coronarium</i>, as it was called, fairly
represented a class of literary workers, who occupied a middle place
between the learned and the laity, and on whom devolved the task of
writing for the people.</p>

<p>Since that unique moment in the history of Tuscan civilization when the
lyrics of Dante and Guido Cavalcanti were heard upon the lips of
blacksmiths, the artisans of Florence had not wholly lost their thirst
for culture. Style and erudition retired into the schools of the
humanists and the studies of the nobles. But this curiosity of the
<i>volgo</i>, as Boccaccio contemptuously called them, was satisfied by the
production of a vernacular literature, which brought the ruder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">-240-</a></span> elements
of knowledge within their reach. Mention has already been made of
Latini's <i>Tesoro</i> and <i>Tesoretto</i>, Uberti's <i>Dittamondo</i> and similar
encyclop&#230;dic works of medieval learning. To these may now be added
Leonardo Dati's cosmographical history in octave stanzas, the Schiavo da
Bari's aphorisms on morality, and Pucci's <i>terza rima</i> version of
Villani's Chronicle. Genealogical poems on popes, emperors and kings;
episodes from national Italian history; novels, romances and tales of
chivalry; pious biographies; the rudiments of education, from the
<i>Dottrinale</i> of Jacopo Alighieri down to Feo Belcari's <i>A B C</i>, helped
to complete the handicraftsman's library. Further to describe this
plebeian literature is hardly necessary. The authors advanced no
pretensions to artistic elegance or stateliness of style. They sought to
render knowledge accessible to unlettered readers, or to please an
open-air audience with stirring and romantic narratives. Their language
broke only at rare intervals into poetry and rhetoric, when the
subject-matter forced a note of unaffected feeling from the
improvisatore. Yet it has always the merit of purity, and, in point of
idiom, is superior to the Latinistic periods of Alberti. By means of the
neglected labors of these nameless writers, the style of the fourteenth
century, so winning in its infantine grace, was gradually transformed
and rendered capable of stronger literary utterance. Those who have
studied a single prose-work of this period&#8212;<i>I Reali di Francia</i>, for
instance, or Belcari's <i>Vita del Beato Colombino</i>, or the <i>Governo della
Famiglia</i> ascribed to Pandolfini&#8212;will be convinced that a real progress
toward grammatical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">-241-</a></span> cohesion and massiveness of structure was made
during those years of the fifteenth century which are usually counted
barren of achievement by literary historians. Italian prose had entered
on the period of adolescence, leading to the manhood of Machiavelli.</p>

<p>The popular poetry of the <i>quattrocento</i> is still more interesting than
its prose. No period of Italian history was probably more fruitful of
songs poured forth from the very heart of the people, on the fields and
in the city. The music of these lyrics still lingers about the Tuscan
highlands and the shores of Sicily, where much that now passes for
original composition is but the echo of most ancient melody stored in
the retentive memory of peasants. To investigate the several species of
this poetry, together with kindred works of prose fiction, under the
several classes of (i) epics and romances, (ii) histories in verse and
satires, (iii) love-poems, (iv) religious lyrics, and (v) dramas, will
be my object in the present and the following chapters. This survey of
popular literature forms a necessary introduction to the renascence
which was simultaneously effected for Italian at Florence, Ferrara and
Naples during the last years of the century. The material prepared by
the people was then resumed and artistically elaborated by learned
authors.</p>

<p>It has been well said that Italian poetry exhibits a continual
reciprocity of exchange between the cultivated classes and the
proletariate. In this respect the literature of the Italians corresponds
to their fine art. Taken together with painting, sculpture, and music,
it offers a more complete embodiment of the national spirit than can be
shown by any other modern race.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">-242-</a></span> Dante's Francesca and Count Ugolino,
Ariosto's golden cantos, and the romantic episodes of the <i>Gerusalemme</i>
are known by heart throughout the length and breadth of the Peninsula.
The people have appropriated these masterpieces of finished art. On the
other hand, the literary poets have been ever careful to borrow
subjects, forms, and motives from the populace. The close <i>rapport</i>
which thus connects the tastes and instincts of the proletariate with
the culture of the aristocracy, is rooted in peculiar conditions of
Italian society. Traditions of a very ancient civilization, derived
without apparent rupture from the Roman age, have penetrated and refined
the whole nation. From the highest to the lowest, the Italians are born
with sensibility to beauty. This people and its poets live in sympathy
so vital that, though their mutual good understanding may have been
suspended for short intervals, it has never been broken. The vibrations
of intercourse between the peasant and the learned writer are incessant;
and if we notice some intermittency of influence on one side or the
other, it is only because at one epoch the destinies of the national
genius were committed to the people, at another to the cultivated
classes. In the fifteenth century, one of these temporary ruptures
occurred. The Revival of Learning had to be effected by an isolation of
the scholars. Meanwhile, the people carried on the work of literary
transmutation, which was to connect Boccaccio with Pulci and Poliziano.
Their instinct rejected all elements alien to the national temperament.
Out of the many models bequeathed by the fourteenth century, only those
which suited the sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">-243-</a></span>suous realism of the Florentines survived. The
traditions of Ciullo d'Alcamo and Jacopone da Todi, of Rustico di
Filippo and Lapo Gianni, of Folgore da S. Gemignano and Cene dalla
Chitarra, of Cecco Angiolieri and Guido Cavalcanti, of Boccaccio and
Sacchetti, of Ser Giovanni and Alesso Donati, triumphed over the
scholasticism of those learned poets&#8212;&quot;half Proven&#231;al and half Latin,
half chivalrous, and half <i>bourgeois</i>, half monastic and half sensual,
half aristocratic and half plebeian&quot;<a name="FNanchor_285_286" id="FNanchor_285_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_286" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>&#8212;who had unsuccessfully
experimentalized in the dawn of Tuscan culture. The artificial chivalry,
lifeless mysticism, barren metaphysics, and hypocritical piety of the
rhyming doctors were eliminated. Common sense expressed itself in a
reaction against their conventional philosophy. Giotto's blunt critique
of Franciscan poverty, Orcagna's burlesque definition of Love, not as a
blind boy with wings and arrows, but thus:</p>

<p>struck the keynote of the new literature.<a name="FNanchor_286_287" id="FNanchor_286_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_287" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> It is true that much was
sacrificed. Both Dante and Petrarch seemed to be forgotten. Yet this was
inevitable. Dante represented a bygone age of faith and reason.
Petrarch's humanity was too exquisitely veiled. The Florentine people
required expression more simple and direct, movement more brusque,
emotion of a coarser fiber. Meanwhile the Divine Comedy and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">-244-</a></span>the
<i>Canzoniere</i> were the inalienable possessions of the nation. They had
already taken rank as classics.</p>

<p>The Italians had no national Epic, if we except the <i>&#198;neid</i>. We have
seen how the romances of Charlemagne and Arthur were imported with the
languages of France and Provence into Northern Italy, and how they
passed into the national literature of Lombardy and Tuscany.<a name="FNanchor_287_288" id="FNanchor_287_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_288" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Both
cycles were eminently popular. The <i>Tavola Ritonda</i> ranks among the
earliest monuments of Tuscan prose.<a name="FNanchor_288_289" id="FNanchor_288_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_289" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The <i>Cento Novelle</i> contain
frequent references to Merlin, Lancelot and Tristram. Folgore da S.
Gemignano compares the members of his Joyous Company to King Ban's
children. In the <i>Laberinto d'Amore</i> Boccaccio speaks of Arthurian tales
as the favorite studies of idle women, and Sacchetti bids his blacksmith
turn from Dante to legends of the Round Table. Yet there is no doubt
that from a very early period the Carolingian cycle gained the
preference of the Italian people.<a name="FNanchor_289_290" id="FNanchor_289_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_290" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> It is also noticeable that, not
the main legend of Roland, but the episode of Rinaldo, and other
offshoots from the history of the Frankish peers, furnished plebeian
poets with their favorite material.<a name="FNanchor_290_291" id="FNanchor_290_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_291" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> MSS. written in Venetian and
Franco-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">-245-</a></span>Italian dialects before the middle of the fourteenth century
attest to the popularity of these subordinate romances, and reveal an
independent handling of the borrowed subject. In form they do not
diverge widely from French originals. Yet there is one prominent
characteristic which distinguishes the Italian <i>rifacimenti</i>. A
Christian hero falls in love with a pagan heroine on pagan soil. His
pursuit of her, their difficulties and adventures, and the
evangelization of her people by the knightly lover, furnish a series of
incidents which recur with singular persistence.<a name="FNanchor_291_292" id="FNanchor_291_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_292" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> When the romances
in question had been translated into Tuscan, a destiny of special
splendor was reserved for two of them, in no way distinguished by any
apparent merit above the rest. These were the tales of Buovo d'Antona,
of which we possess an early version in octave stanzas, and of
Fioravante, which exists in still older prose. About the beginning of
the fifteenth century, the <i>Buovo</i> and the <i>Fioravante</i>, together with
other material drawn from the Carolingian epic, were combined into the
great prose work called <i>I Reali di Francia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_292_293" id="FNanchor_292_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_293" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Since its first
appearance to the present day, this romance has never ceased to be the
most widely popular of all books written in Italian. &quot;There is nothing,&quot;
says Signor Rajna, &quot;so assiduously read from the Alps to the furthest
headlands of Sicily. Wherever a reader exists, there is it certain to be
found in honor.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_293_294" id="FNanchor_293_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_294" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Not the earliest but <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">-246-</a></span>the latest product of a long
elaboration of romantic matter by the people, it seems to have
assimilated the very essence of the popular imagination. When we inquire
into its authorship, we find good reason to ascribe it to Andrea dei
Mangalotti of Barberino in the Val d'Elsa, one of the best and most
indefatigable workmen for the literary market of the proletariate.<a name="FNanchor_294_295" id="FNanchor_294_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_295" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
It was he who compiled the <i>Aspromonte</i>, the <i>Aiolfo</i>, the seven books
of <i>Storie Nerbonesi</i>, the <i>Ugone d'Avernia</i>, and the <i>Guerino il
Meschino</i>, reducing these tales from elder poems and prose sources into
Tuscan of sterling lucidity and vigor, and attempting, it would seem, to
embrace the whole Carolingian cycle in a series of episodical
romances.<a name="FNanchor_295_296" id="FNanchor_295_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_296" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> <i>Guerino il Meschino</i> rivaled for a while the <i>Reali</i> in
popularity; but for some unknown reason, which would have to be sought
in the instinctive partialities of the people, it was gradually
superseded by the latter. The <i>Reali</i> alone has descended in its
original form through the press to this century.<a name="FNanchor_296_297" id="FNanchor_296_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_297" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>Andrea da Barberino, if we are right in ascribing the <i>Reali</i> to his
pen, conferred a benefit on the Italians parallel to that which the
English owed to Sir Thomas Mallory in his &quot;Mort d'Arthur.&quot; He not only
collected and condensed the scattered tales of numerous unknown
predecessors, but he also bequeathed to the nation a monument of
unaffected prose at a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">-247-</a></span>moment when the language was still ingenuous and
plastic. It would be not uninteresting to compare the fate of the
<i>Reali</i> with that of our own &quot;Mort d'Arthur.&quot; The latter was the more
artistic performance of the two. It achieved a truer epical unity, and
was composed in a richer, more romantic style. The former remained
episodical and incomplete; and its language, though solid and efficient,
lacked the charm of Mallory's all golden prose. Yet the <i>Reali</i> is still
a household classic. It is found in every <i>contadino's</i> cottage, and
supplies the peasantry with subjects for their <i>Maggi</i>. The &quot;Mort
d'Arthur,&quot; on the contrary, has become the plaything of medievalizing
folk in modern England. Read for its unique beauty by students, it is
still unknown to the people, and, in the opinion of the dull majority,
it is reckoned inferior to Tennyson's smooth imitations.</p>

<p>When we come to consider the romantic poems of Pulci, Boiardo, and
Ariosto, we shall be able to estimate the service rendered by men like
Andrea da Barberino to polite Italian literature. The popularity of the
cycle to which the <i>Reali</i> belonged, decided the choice of the
Carolingian epic by the poets of Florence and Ferrara. Nor were the
above-mentioned romances by any means the only works of their kind
produced for a plebeian audience in the <i>quattrocento</i>. It is enough to
mention <i>La Regina Ancroja</i>, <i>La Spagna</i>, <i>Trebisonda con la Vita e
Morte di Rinaldo</i>. Both in prose and verse an abundant literature of the
kind was manufactured. Without being positively burlesqued, the heroes
of chivalrous story were travestied to suit the taste of artisans and
burghers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">-248-</a></span> The element of the marvelous was surcharged; comic and
pathetic episodes were multiplied; beneath the armor of the Paladins
Italian characters were substituted with spontaneous malice for the
obsolete ideals of feudalism. It only needed a touch of conscious irony
to convert the material thus elaborated by the people into the airy
fabric of Ariosto's art. At the same time the form which the epic of
romance was destined to assume, had been determined. The streets and
squares of town and village rang with the chants of improvisatori,
turning the prose periods of Andrea da Barberino and his predecessors
into wordy octave stanzas, rehandling ancient <i>Chansons de Geste</i>, and
adapting the mannerism of chivalrous minstrelsy to the requirements of a
subtle-witted Tuscan crowd. The old-fashioned invocations of God,
Madonna, or some saint were preserved at the beginning of each canto,
while the audience received their <i>cong&#233;</i> from the author at its close.
When the poems thus produced were committed to writing, the plebeian
author feigned at least the inspiration of a bard.</p>

<p>While the traditions of medieval song were thus preserved, the
prose-romances followed, as closely as possible, the style of a
chronicle, and aimed at the verisimilitude of authentic history. The
<i>Reali</i>, for example, opens with this sentence: &quot;Fuvvi in Roma un santo
pastore della Chiesa, che aveva nome papa Silvestro.&quot; The <i>Fioravante</i>,
recently edited by Signor Rajna, begins: &quot;Nel tempo che Gostantino
imperadore regiea &amp; mantenea corte in Roma grandissima.&quot; This parade of
historic seriousness, observed by the subsequent romantic poets,
contributed in no small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">-249-</a></span> measure to the irony at which they aimed. But
with the story-tellers of the <i>quattrocento</i> it was no mere affectation.
Like their predecessors of the fourteenth century, they treated legend
from the standpoint of experience. It was due in no small measure to
this circumstance that the Italian prose-romances are devoid of charm.
Nowhere do we find in them that magic touch of poetry which makes the
forests, seas and castles of the &quot;Mort d'Arthur&quot; enchanted ground.
Notwithstanding all their extravagances, they remain positive in spirit,
presenting the material of fancy in the sober garb of fact. The Italian
genius lacked a something of imaginative potency possessed in
overflowing measure by the Northern nations. It required the stimulus of
satire, the infusion of idyllic sentiment, the consciousness of art, to
raise the romantic epic to the height it reached in Ariosto. Then, and
not till then, when the matter of the legend had become the sport of the
&#230;sthetic sense, were the inexhaustible riches of Italian fancy, dealing
delicately and humorously with a subject which could no longer be
apprehended seriously, revealed to the world in a masterpiece of beauty.
But that work of consummate art was what it was, by reason of the
master's wise employment of a style transmitted to him through
generations of plebeian predecessors.</p>

<p>The same positive and workmanly method is discernible in the versified
<i>novelle</i> of this period.<a name="FNanchor_297_298" id="FNanchor_297_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_298" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">-250-</a></span> popular poets were wont to recast
tales from the Decameron and other sources in octave stanzas. Of such
compositions we have excellent specimens in Girolamo Benivieni's version
of the novel of Tancredi, and in an anonymous rhymed paraphrase of
Patient Grizzel.<a name="FNanchor_298_299" id="FNanchor_298_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_299" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The latter is especially interesting when we
compare it with the series of panels attributed to Pinturicchio in the
National Gallery, where a painter of the same period has exercised his
fancy in illustrating the legend which the poet versified. Detached
episodes of semi-mythical Florentine history were similarly treated.
Allusion has already been made to the love-tale of Ippolito and Leonora,
attributed on doubtful grounds to Alberti.<a name="FNanchor_299_300" id="FNanchor_299_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_300" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> But by far the most
beautiful is the story of Ginevra degli Almieri, told in octave stanzas
by Agostino Velletti.<a name="FNanchor_300_301" id="FNanchor_300_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_301" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> This poem has rare value as a genuine product
of the plebeian muse. The heroine Ginevra's father was a pork-butcher,
says <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">-251-</a></span>the minstrel, and lived in the Marcato Vecchio, where he carried
on the best business of the sort in Florence. It is also important for
students of comparative literature, because it clearly illustrates the
difference between Italian and Northern treatment of an all but
contemporary incident. The events narrated are supposed to have really
happened in the year 1396. On the Scotch Border they would have
furnished materials for a ballad similar to Gil Morrice or Clerk
Saunders. In Florence they take the form of a <i>novella</i>, and the
<i>novella</i> is expanded in octave stanzas.<a name="FNanchor_301_302" id="FNanchor_301_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_302" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Ginevra had two lovers,
Antonio de' Rondinelli and Francesco degli Agolanti. Antonio loved her
the more tenderly; but her parents gave her in marriage to Francesco.
Soon after the ceremony, she sickened and fell into a trance; and since
Florence was then threatened with the plague, the girl was buried
over-hastily in this deep slumber. Her weeping parents laid her in a
cippus or <i>avello</i> between the two doors of S. Reparata, where the
workmen, unable to finish their job before sunset, left the lid of her
sepulcher unsoldered. In the middle of the night Ginevra woke, and
discovered to her horror that she had been sent to the grave alive.
Happily the moon was shining, and a ray of light fell through a chink
upon her bier. She arose, wrapped her shroud around her, and struggled
from her marble chest into the silent cathedral square. Giotto's bell
tower rose above her, silvery and beautiful, and slender in the
moonlight. Like a ghost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">-252-</a></span> sheeted in her grave-clothes, Ginevra ran
through the streets, and knocked first at Francesco's door. He was
seated awake by the fireside, sorrowing for his young bride's loss:</p>

<p>The poor wretch now feels that there is nothing left for her but to lie
down on the pavement and die of cold. But while she is preparing herself
for this fate, she bethinks her of Antonio. To his house she hurries,
cries for aid, and falls exhausted on the doorstep. Then comes the
finest touch in the poem. Antonio knows Ginevra's voice; and loving her
so tenderly, he hurries with delight to greet her risen from the grave.
He alone has no fear and no misgiving; for love in him is stronger than
death. At the street door, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">-253-</a></span> he reaches it, he finds no ghost, but
his own dear lady yet alive. She is half frozen and unconscious; yet her
heart still beats. How he calls the women of his household to attend
her, prepares a bed, and feeds her with warm soups and wine, and how she
revives, and how Antonio claims her for his wife, and wins his cause
against her former bridegroom in the Bishop's court, may be read at
length in the concluding portion of the tale. The intrinsic pathos of
this story makes it a real poem; for though the wizard's wand of
Northern imagination lay beyond the grasp of the Italian genius, the
<i>novelle</i> are rarely deficient in poetry evoked by sympathy with injured
innocence and loyal love.</p>

<p>Of truly popular <i>novelle</i> belonging to the fifteenth century, none is
racier or more characteristic than the anonymous tale of <i>Il Grasso,
Legnaiuolo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_302_303" id="FNanchor_302_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_303" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> It is written in pure Florentine dialect, and might be
selected as the finest extant specimen of homespun Tuscan humor. We have
already seen that the point of Sacchetti's stories is nearly always a
practical joke, where comedy combines with heartless cruelty in almost
equal parts. The theme of <i>Il Grasso</i> is a superlatively comic <i>beffa</i>
of this sort, played by Filippo Brunelleschi on a friend of his. The
incident is dated 1409, and is supposed to have really occurred. Manetto
Ammannatini, a <i>tarsiatore</i> or worker in carved and inlaid wood, was
called <i>Il Grasso</i>, because he was a fine stout fellow of twenty-eight
years. He had his <i>bottega</i> on the Piazza S. Giovanni and lived with his
brother in a house hard by. Among his most intimate associates were
Filippo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">-254-</a></span> di Ser Brunellesco, Donatello, <i>intagliatore di marmi</i>,
Giovanni di Messer Francesco Rucellai, and others, partly gentlemen and
partly handicraftsmen; for there was no abrupt division of classes at
Florence, and this story shows how artisans and men of high condition
dwelt together in good fellowship. The practical joke devised by
Brunelleschi consisted in persuading Manetto that he had been changed
into a certain Matteo. The whole society of friends were in the secret,
and the affair was so cunningly conducted that at last they attained the
desired object. They caused Manetto to be arrested for a debt of Matteo,
sent Matteo's brothers and then the clergyman of the parish to reason
with him on his spendthrift habits, and fooled him so that he fairly
lost his sense of identity. The whole series of incidents, beginning
with Manetto's indignant assertion of his proper personality, passing
through his doubts, and closing with his mystification, is conducted by
fine gradations of irresistibly comic humor. At last the poor man
resolves to quit Florence and to seek refuge with King Mathias Corvinus
in Hungary; which it seems he subsequently did, in company with a
certain Lo Spano. There is no reason to suppose that this practical joke
did not actually take place.</p>

<p>I have enlarged upon the <i>novella</i> of <i>Il Grasso</i>, because it is typical
of the genuinely popular literature, written to delight the folk of
Florence, appealing to their subtlest as well as broadest sense of fun,
and bringing on the scene two famous artists, Brunelleschi, whose cupola
is &quot;raised above the heavens,&quot; and Donatello, whose S. George seems
stepping from his pedestal to challenge all the evil of the world and
conquer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">-255-</a></span> it. Unfortunately, our published collections are not rich in
novels of this date; and next to the anonymous tale of <i>Il Grasso,
Legnaiuolo</i> it is difficult to cite one of at all equal value, till we
come to Luigi Pulci's story of Messer Goro and Pius II. This is really a
satire on the Sienese, whom Pulci represents with Florentine malice as
almost inconceivably silly. The Tuscan style is piquant in the extreme,
and the picture of manners very brilliant.<a name="FNanchor_303_304" id="FNanchor_303_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_304" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>From epical and narrative literature to poems written for the people
upon contemporary events and public history, is not an unnatural
transition. These compositions divide themselves into <i>Storie</i> and
<i>Lamenti</i>. We have abundant examples of both kinds in lyric measures and
also in octave stanzas and <i>terza rima</i>.<a name="FNanchor_304_305" id="FNanchor_304_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_305" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> A few of their titles will
suffice to indicate their scope. <i>Il Lamento di Giuliano de' Medici</i>
relates the tragic ending of the Pazzi conspiracy; <i>Il Lamento del Duca
Galeazzo Maria</i> tells how that Duke was murdered in the church of S.
Stefano at Milan; <i>El Lamento di Otranto</i> is an echo of the disaster
which shook all Italy to her foundations in the year 1480; <i>El Lamento e
la Discordia de Italia universale</i> sounds the death-note of Italian
freedom in the last years of the century. After that period the <i>Pianti</i>
and <i>Lamenti</i>, attesting to the sorrows of a nation, increase in
frequency until all voices from the people are hushed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">-256-</a></span>in the leaden
sleep of Spanish despotism.<a name="FNanchor_305_306" id="FNanchor_305_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_306" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> The <i>Storie</i> in like manner are more
abundant between the years 1494 and 1530, when the wars of foreign
invaders supplied the bards of the market-place with continual matter
for improvisation. Among the earliest may be mentioned two poems on the
Battle of Anghiari and the taking of Serezana.<a name="FNanchor_306_307" id="FNanchor_306_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_307" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Then the list
proceeds with the tale of the Borgias, <i>Guerre Orrende</i>, <i>Rotta di
Ravenna</i>, <i>Mali deportamenti de Franciosi fato in Italia</i>, and so forth,
till it ends with <i>La Presa di Roma</i> and <i>Rotta di Ferruccio</i>. A last
echo of these <i>Storie</i> and <i>Lamenti</i>&#8212;for alas! in Italy of the
sixteenth century history and lamentation were all one&#8212;still sounds
about the hillsides of Siena<a name="FNanchor_307_308" id="FNanchor_307_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_308" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>:</p>

<p>It may be well to say how these poems reached the people, before they
were committed to writing or the press. There existed a professional
class of rhymsters, usually blind men, if we may judge by the frequent
affix of <i>Cieco</i> to their names, who tuned their guitar in the streets,
and when a crowd had gathered round them, broke into some legend of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">-257-</a></span>romance, or told a tale of national misfortune. The Italian designation
of these minstrels is <i>Cantatore in Banca</i> or <i>Cantore di piazza</i>. In
the high tide of Florentine freedom the <i>Cantore di piazza</i> exercised a
noble calling; for through his verse the voice of the common folk made
itself heard beneath the very windows of the Signoria. In 1342, when the
war with Pisa turned against the Florentines owing to the incompetence
of their generals, Antonio Pucci, who was the most celebrated
<i>Cantatore</i> of the day, took his lute and placed himself upon the steps
beneath the Palazzo, and having invoked the Virgin Mary, struck up a
<i>Sermintese</i> on the duty of making peace<a name="FNanchor_308_309" id="FNanchor_308_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_309" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>:</p>

<p>Other poems of the same kind by Antonio Pucci belong to the year 1346,
or celebrate the purchase of Lucca from Mastino della Scala, or the
victory of Messer Piero Rosso at Padua, or the expulsion of the Duke of
Athens from Florence in 1348. It must not be supposed that the
<i>Cantatori in Banca</i> of the next century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">-258-</a></span> enjoyed so much liberty of
censure or had so high a sense of their vocation as Antonio Pucci. Yet
the people made their opinions freely heard in rhymes sung even by the
children through the streets, as when they angered Martin V. in 1420 by
crying beneath his very windows<a name="FNanchor_309_310" id="FNanchor_309_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_310" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>:</p>

<p>During the ascendency of Savonarola and the party-struggles of the
Medici the rival cries of <i>Palle</i> and <i>Viva Cristo R&#232;</i> were turned into
street songs<a name="FNanchor_310_311" id="FNanchor_310_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_311" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>; but at last, after the siege and the victory of

<p>The element of satire in these ditties of the people leads me to speak
of one very prominent poet of the fifteenth century&#8212;Domenico di
Giovanni, called Il Burchiello, the rhyming barber.<a name="FNanchor_312_313" id="FNanchor_312_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_313" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> He was born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">-259-</a></span>probably in 1403 at Florence, where his father, who was a Pisan, had
acquired the rights of citizenship and followed the trade of a barber.
Their shop was situated in Calimala, and formed a meeting-place for the
wits, who carried Burchiello's verses over the town. The boy seems to
have studied at Pisa, and acquired some slight knowledge of
medicine.<a name="FNanchor_313_314" id="FNanchor_313_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_314" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> At the age of four-and-twenty we find him married, with
three children and no property.<a name="FNanchor_314_315" id="FNanchor_314_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_315" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Soon after this date, he separated
from his wife; or else she left him on account of his irregular and
dissolute habits. Peering through the obscurity of his somewhat sordid
history, we see him getting into trouble with the Inquisition on account
of profane speech, and then espousing the cause of the Albizzi against
the Medicean faction. On the return of Cosimo de' Medici in 1434,
Burchiello was obliged to leave Florence. He settled at Siena, and
opened a shop in the Corso di Camollia, hoping to attract the
Florentines whose business brought them to that quarter. Here he nearly
ruined his health by debauchery, and narrowly escaped assassination at
the hands of a certain Ser Rosello.<a name="FNanchor_315_316" id="FNanchor_315_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_316" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Leaving Siena about 1440,
Burchiello spent the last years of his life in wandering through the
cities of Italy. We hear of him at Venice entertained by one of the
Alberti family, then at Naples, finally in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">-260-</a></span>Rome, where he died in 1448,
poisoned probably by Robert, a bastard of Pandolfo Sigismondo Malatesta,
at the instigation of his ancient enemy, Cosimo de' Medici.<a name="FNanchor_316_317" id="FNanchor_316_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_317" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Such
long arms and such retentive memory had the merchant despot.</p>

<p>Burchiello's sonnets were collected some thirty years after his death
and published simultaneously at various places.<a name="FNanchor_317_318" id="FNanchor_317_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_318" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> They owed their
popularity partly to their political subject-matter, but more to their
strange humor. A foreigner can scarcely understand their language, far
less appreciate their fun; for not only are they composed in Florentine
slang of the fifteenth century, but this slang itself consists of
detached phrases and burlesque allusions, chipped as it were from
current speech, broken into splinters, and then wrought into a grotesque
mosaic. That Burchiello had the merit of originality, and that he caught
the very note of plebeian utterance, is manifest from the numerous
editions and imitations of his sonnets.<a name="FNanchor_318_319" id="FNanchor_318_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_319" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> His Muse was a <i>volgivaga
Venus</i> bred among the taverns and low haunts of vulgar company, whose
biting wit introduced her to the society of the learned. Yet her
utterances, at this distance of time, are so obscure and their point has
been so blunted that to profess an admiration for Burchiello savors of
literary affectation.<a name="FNanchor_319_320" id="FNanchor_319_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_320" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> He was a poet of the transition; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">-261-</a></span>burlesque style which he made popular was destined to be superseded by
the more refined and subtle Bernesque manner. Il Lasca, writing in the
sixteenth century, expressed himself strongly against those who still
ventured to compare Burchiello with the author of <i>Le Pesche</i>. &quot;Let no
one talk to me of Burchiello; to rank him with Berni is no better than
to couple the fiend Charon with the Angel Gabriel.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_320_321" id="FNanchor_320_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_321" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>Not the least important branch of popular poetry in its bearing on the
future of Italian literature was the strictly lyrical. In treating of
these Volkslieder, it will be necessary to consider them under the two
aspects of secular and religious&#8212;the former destined to supply
Poliziano and Lorenzo de' Medici with models for their purest works of
literary art, the latter containing the germs of the Florentine Sacred
Play within the strophes of a hymn.</p>

<p>If we return to the golden days of the fourteenth century, we find that
Dante's, Boccaccio's and Sacchetti's <i>Ballate</i> descended to the people
and were easily adapted to their needs.<a name="FNanchor_321_322" id="FNanchor_321_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_322" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Minute comparison of
Dante's dance-song of the <i>Ghirlandetta</i> with the version in use among
the common folk will show what slight alterations were needed in order
to render it the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">-262-</a></span>property of 'prentice lads and spinning maidens, and
at the same time how subtle those changes were.<a name="FNanchor_322_323" id="FNanchor_322_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_323" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Dante's song might
be likened to a florin fresh from the mint; the popular ditty to the
same coin after it had circulated for a year or two, exchanging
something of its sharp lines for the smoothness of currency and usage.
The same is true of Boccaccio's Ballata, <i>Il fior che 'l valor perde</i>;
except that here the transformation has gone deeper, and, if such a
criticism may be hazarded, has bettered the original by rendering the
sentiment more universal.<a name="FNanchor_323_324" id="FNanchor_323_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_324" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Sacchetti's charming song <i>O vaghe
montanine pasturelle</i> underwent the same process of metamorphosis before
it assumed the form in which it passed for a composition of
Poliziano.<a name="FNanchor_324_325" id="FNanchor_324_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_325" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Starting with poems of this quality, the rhymsters of
the market-place had noble models, and the use they made of them was
adequate. We cannot from the wreck of time recover very many that were
absolutely written for the people by the people; but we can judge of
their quality by Angelo Poliziano's imitations.<a name="FNanchor_325_326" id="FNanchor_325_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_326" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> He borrowed so
largely from all sources, and his debts can be so accurately traced in
his <i>rispetti</i>, that it is fair to credit the popular Muse with even
such delicate work as <i>La Brunettina</i>, while the disputed authorship of
the May-song <i>Ben venga Maggio</i> and of the Ballata <i>Vaghe le montanine e
pastorelle</i> is sufficient to prove at least their widespread fame.<a name="FNanchor_326_327" id="FNanchor_326_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_327" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
Whoever wrote them, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">-263-</a></span>they became the heirlooms of the people. If proof
were needed of the vast number of such compositions in the fifteenth
century&#8212;erotic, humorous, and not unfrequently obscene&#8212;it might be
derived from the rubrics of the <i>Laude</i> or hymns, which were almost
invariably parodies of popular dance-songs and intended to be sung to
the same tunes.<a name="FNanchor_327_328" id="FNanchor_327_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_328" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Every festivity&#8212;May-morning tournaments, summer
evening dances on the squares of Florence, weddings, carnival
processions, and vintage-banquets at the villa&#8212;had their own lyrics,
accompanied with music and the Carola.</p>

<p>The dance-songs and canzonets, of which we have been speaking, were
chiefly of town growth and Tuscan. Another kind of popular love-poem,
common to all the dialects of Italy, may be regarded as a special
production of the country. Much has lately been written concerning these
<i>Rispetti</i>, <i>Strambotti</i> and <i>Stornelli</i>.<a name="FNanchor_328_329" id="FNanchor_328_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_329" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Ample collections have
been made to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">-264-</a></span>illustrate their local peculiarities. Their points of
resemblance and dissimilarity have been subjected to critical analysis,
and great ingenuity has been expended on the problem of their origin. It
will be well to preface what has to be said about them with some
explanation of terms. There are, to begin with, two distinct species.
The <i>Stornello Ritornello</i> or <i>Fiore</i>, called also <i>Ciure</i> in Sicily,
properly consists of two or three verses starting with the name of a
flower. Thus<a name="FNanchor_329_330" id="FNanchor_329_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_330" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>:</p>

<p><i>Rispetto</i> and <i>Strambotto</i> are two names for the same kind of song,
which in the north-eastern provinces is also called <i>Villotta</i> and in
Sicily <i>Canzune</i>.<a name="FNanchor_330_331" id="FNanchor_330_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_331" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Strictly speaking, the term <i>Strambotto</i> should
be confined to literary imitations of the popular <i>Rispetto</i>. In Tuscany
the lyric in question consists, in its normal form, of four alternately
rhyming hendecasyllabic lines, followed by what is technically called
the <i>ripresa</i>, or repetition, which may be composed of two, four, or
even more verses. Though not strictly an octave stanza, it sometimes
falls into this shape, and has then two pairs of three alternate rhymes,
finished up with a couplet. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">-265-</a></span>In the following instance the quatrain and
the <i>ripresa</i> are well marked<a name="FNanchor_331_332" id="FNanchor_331_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_332" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>:</p>

<p>In Sicily the <i>Canzune</i> exhibits a stanza of eight lines rhyming
alternately throughout upon two sounds. Certain peculiarities, however,
in the structure of the strophe render it probable that it was
originally a quatrain followed by a <i>ripresa</i> of the same length.

<p>Though these are the leading types of the <i>Rispetto</i>, <i>Canzune</i> and
<i>Villotta</i>, each district exhibits a variety of subordinate and complex
forms. The same may be said about the <i>Stornello</i>, <i>Ritornello</i> and
<i>Ciure</i>. The names, too, are very variously applied; nor without
pedantry would it be possible to maintain perfect precision in their
usage.<a name="FNanchor_334_335" id="FNanchor_334_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_335" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> It is enough to have indicated the two broad classes into
which popular poetry of this kind is divided. For the future I shall
refer to the one sort as <i>Rispetti</i>, to the other as <i>Stornelli</i>.</p>

<p>Comparative analysis makes it clear that the <i>Rispetti</i> and <i>Stornelli</i>
scattered over all the provinces of Italy, constitute a common fund.
That is to say, we do not meet with the <i>Rispetti</i> of each dialect
confined to their own region; but the same original <i>Rispetto</i>, perhaps
now lost to sight, has been adapted and transformed to suit the taste
and idiom of the several prov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">-267-</a></span>inces. To reconstitute the primitive type,
to decide with certainty in each case the true source of these lyrics,
is probably impossible. All we know for certain is that beneath apparent
dialectical divergences the vulgar poetry of the Italians presents
unmistakable signs of identity.<a name="FNanchor_335_336" id="FNanchor_335_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_336" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Which province was the primitive
home of the <i>Rispetti</i>; whether Sicily, where the faculty for
reproducing them is still most vivid<a name="FNanchor_336_337" id="FNanchor_336_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_337" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>; or Tuscany, where they
certainly attain their purest form and highest beauty; or whether all
Italian country districts have contributed their quota to the general
stock; are difficult questions, as yet by no means satisfactorily
decided. Professor d'Ancona advances a theory, which is too plausible to
be ignored in silence. <i>Rispetti</i>, he suggests, were first produced in
Sicily, whence they traveled through Central Italy, receiving
dialectical transmutation in Tuscany, and there also attaining to the
perfection of their structure.<a name="FNanchor_337_338" id="FNanchor_337_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_338" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Numerous slight indications lead to
the conclusion that their original linguistic type was southern. The
imagery also which is common in verses sung to this day by the peasants
of the Pistoja highlands, including frequent references to the sea with
metaphors borrowed from orange-trees and palms, seems to indicate a
Sicilian birthplace.<a name="FNanchor_338_339" id="FNanchor_338_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_339" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> We have, moreover, the early evidence <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">-268-</a></span>of six
<i>Napolitane</i> copied from a Magliabecchian MS. of the fourteenth century,
which exhibit the transition from southern to Tuscan idiom and
structure.<a name="FNanchor_339_340" id="FNanchor_339_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_340" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> One of these still exists in several dialects, under the
title of <i>La Rondinella importuna</i>.<a name="FNanchor_340_341" id="FNanchor_340_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_341" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> It is therefore certain that
many <i>Rispetti</i> are very ancient, dating from the Suabian period, when
Sicilian poetry, as we have seen, underwent the process of
<i>toscaneggiamento</i>. However, D'Ancona's theory is too hypothetical, and
it may also be said, too neat, to be accepted without reservation.</p>

<p>One point, at any rate, may be considered certain. Though the <i>Rispetti</i>
are still alive upon the lips of <i>contadini</i>; though we may hear them
echoing from farm and field through all the length and breadth of Italy;
though the voluminous collections we possess have recently been gathered
from <i>viva voce</i> recitation; yet they are perhaps as ancient as the
dialects. The proof of this antiquity lies in the fact that whether we
take the literary <i>Strambotti</i> of Poliziano for our standard, or the
<i>pasticci</i>, <i>incatenature</i> and <i>intrecciature</i> of the sixteenth century
for guides, we find the phrases and the style that are familiar to us in
the rural lyrics of to-day.<a name="FNanchor_341_342" id="FNanchor_341_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_342" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Bronzino's <i>Serenata</i> and the
<i>Incatenatura</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">-269-</a></span>of Bianchino contain, embedded in their structure,
ditties which were universally known in the sixteenth century, and which
are being sung still with unimportant alterations by the people. The
attention of learned men was directed in the renascence of Tuscan
literature to the beauty of these lyrics. Poliziano, writing to Lorenzo
de' Medici in 1488, and describing his journey with Pietro through
Montepulciano and Acquapendente in the month of May, says that he and
his companions amused themselves with <i>rappresaglie</i> or adaptations of
the songs they heard upon the way.<a name="FNanchor_342_343" id="FNanchor_342_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_343" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> His road took him through what
is still one of the best sources of local verse and music; and we may
believe that at the close of the fifteenth century, the <i>contadini</i> of
that district were singing nearly the same words as now. Nor, when we
examine the points of similarity and difference in the Italian
<i>Rispetti</i> and <i>Stornelli</i>, as they now exist, is there anything
improbable in this antiquity. Nothing but great age can account for
their adaptation to the tone, feeling, fancy, habits and language of so
many regions. It must have taken more than a century or two to rub down
their original angles, to efface the specific stamp of their birthplace,
and to make them pass for home productions in Venice no less than
Palermo, in Tuscan Montalcino and Ligurian Chiavari.</p>

<p>The retentiveness of the popular memory, before it has been spoiled by
education, is quite sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">-270-</a></span> account for the preservation of these
lyrics through several hundred years. Nor need their wide diffusion
suggest difficulties. Italy in the middle ages offered readier means of
intercommunication between the inhabitants of her provinces than she has
done since the settlement of the country in 1530. When the liberation of
the Communes gave a new impulse to intellectual and commercial activity,
there began a steady and continually increasing movement from one city
to another. Commercial enterprise led the burghers of Pisa, Lucca,
Florence, Venice, Genoa, to establish themselves as bankers and
middle-men, brokers and manufacturers, in Rome and Naples. Soldiers of
adventure flocked from the south, and made the northern towns their
temporary home. The sanctuaries of Gargano, Loretto and Assisi drew
pilgrims from all quarters. Noblemen of Romagna acted as <i>podest&#224;</i>
beyond the Apennines, while Lombards opened shops in Palermo. Churchmen
bred upon the Riviera wore the miter in the March; natives of the
Spoletano taught in the schools of Bologna and Pavia. Men of letters,
humanists and artists had no fixed dwelling-place, but wandered, like
mercenary soldiers, from town to town in search of better pay. Students
roamed from school to school according as the fame of great professors
drew them. Party-quarrels in the commonwealths drove whole families,
such as the Florentine Uberti, Alberti, Albizzi, Strozzi, into exile.
Conquered cities, like Pisa, sent forth their burghers by hundreds as
emigrants, too proud to bear the yoke of foes they had resisted. Nor
were the Courts of princes without their influence in mingling the
natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">-271-</a></span> of different districts. Whether, then, we study the <i>Novelle</i>,
or the histories of great houses, or the biographies of eminent
Italians, or the records of the universities, we shall be led to the
conclusion that from the year 1200 to the year 1550 there was a
perpetual and lively intercourse by land and sea between the departments
of Italy. This reciprocity of influence did not cease until the two
despotic races, Austrian and Spaniard, threw each separate province into
solitary chains. Such being the conditions of social exchange at the
epoch when the language was in process of formation, there is nothing
strange in finding the rural poetry of the south acclimatized in central
and northern Italy. But the very facility of communication and the
probable antiquity of these lyrics should make us cautious in adopting
any rigid hypothesis about their origin. It is reasonable to suppose
that such transferable property as love-poems might have been everywhere
produced and rapidly diffused, the best from each center surviving by a
natural process of selection. Lastly, whatever view may be taken of
their formation and their age, we have every reason to believe that the
fifteenth century was a fruitful period of production and accumulation.
Toward the close of the <i>quattrocento</i> they attracted the curiosity of
lettered poets, who began to imitate them, and in the next hundred years
they were committed in large numbers to the press.<a name="FNanchor_343_344" id="FNanchor_343_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_344" class="fnanchor">[343]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">-272-</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the influence exercised by these popular lyrics over
polite literature in the golden age of the Renaissance, extraordinary
interest attaches to them as an indigenous species of verse, dating from
remote antiquity and still surviving in all corners of the country. In
them we analyze the Italian poetic genius at its source and under its
most genuine conditions. Both from their qualities and their defects
inferences may be drawn, which find application and illustration in the
solemn works of laureled singers. The one theme of <i>Rispetti</i> and
<i>Stornelli</i> is love; but love in all its phases and with all its retinue
of associated emotions&#8212;expectation, fruition, disappointment, jealousy,
despair, rejection, treachery, desertion, pleading, scorn&#8212;the joys of
presence, the pangs of absence, the ecstasy of union, the agony of
parting&#8212;love, natural and unaffected, turbulent or placid, chaste or
troubled with desire, imperious or humble, tempestuously passionate or
toned to tranquil acquiescence&#8212;love varying through all moods and
tempers, yet never losing its note of spontaneity, sincerity and truth.
The instincts of the people are pure, and their utterances of affection
are singularly free from grossness. This at least is almost universally
the case with lyrics gathered from the country. Approaching town-life,
they lose their delicacy; and the products of the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">-273-</a></span> are not
unfrequently distinguished by the crudest obscenity.<a name="FNanchor_344_345" id="FNanchor_344_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_345" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> The literary
form of many of these masterpieces exhibits the beauty of rhythm, the
refinement of outline, which we associate with melodies of the best
Italian period&#8212;with chants of Pergolese, songs of Salvator Rosa. When
we compare their subject-matter with that of our Northern Ballads, we
notice a marked deficiency of legend, superstition or grotesque fancy.
There are no witches, dragons, demon-lovers, no enchanted forests, no
mythical heroes, no noble personages, few ghosts, few dreams and
visions, in these songs poured forth among the olive-trees and
myrtle-groves of Italy. Human nature, conscious of pleasure and of pain,
finding its primitive emotion an adequate motive for verse subtly
modulated through a thousand keys, is here sufficient to itself. The
echoes imported from an outer world of passion and romance and action
into this charmed region of the lover's heart are rare and feeble.
Through all their national vicissitudes, the Italian peasants followed
one sole aim in verse. The <i>Rispetti</i> of all times, localities and
dialects form one protracted, ever-varying Duo between Thou and I, the
<i>dama</i> and the <i>damo</i>, the eternal protagonists in the play of youth and
love.</p>

<p>This absence of legendary and historical material marks a main
difference between Italian and Teutonic inspiration. Among the Italic
communities the practical historic sense was early developed, and
sustained by the tradition of a classic past. It demanded a positive
rather than imaginative treatment of contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">-274-</a></span> fact and mythus.
Among the people this requirement was satisfied by <i>Storie</i>, <i>Lamenti</i>,
and prose Chronicles. Very few, indeed, are the relics of either
romantic or actual history surviving in the lyrics of the rural
population. Only here and there, in dim allusions to the Sicilian
Vespers and the Norman Conquest, in the tale of the Baronessa di Carini,
or in the Northern legend of Rosmunda, under its popular form of <i>La
Donna Lombarda</i>, do we find a faint analogy between the Italian and
Teutonic ballads.<a name="FNanchor_345_346" id="FNanchor_345_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_346" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Dramatic, mythical and epical elements are almost
wholly wanting in the genuine lyrics of the people.</p>

<p>This statement requires some qualification. The four volumes of <i>Fiabe,
Novelle e Racconti</i> recently published by Signor Pitr&#232;, prove that the
Sicilians in prose at least have a copious literature corresponding to
German <i>M&#228;rchen</i> and Norse tales.<a name="FNanchor_346_347" id="FNanchor_346_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_347" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> This literature, however, has not
received poetic treatment in any existing southern songs that have been
published, excepting in the few already noticed. At the same time, it
must be mentioned that the collections of lyrics in north-western
dialects&#8212;especially the <i>Canti Monferrini</i>, <i>Canzoni Comasche</i>, and
<i>Canti Leccesi</i>&#8212;exhibit specimens of genuine ballads. It would seem
that contact with French and German borderers along the Alpine rampart
had introduced into Piedmont and Lombardy a form of lyric which is not
essentially Italian. Had I space sufficient at disposal, I should <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">-275-</a></span>like
to quote the <i>Donna Lombarda</i>, <i>Moglie Infedele</i>, <i>Giuseppina
Parricida</i>, <i>Principessa Giovanna</i>, <i>Giuliano della Croce Bianca</i>,
<i>Cecilia</i>, <i>R&#232; Carlino</i>, <i>Morando</i>, and several others from Ferraro's
collection.<a name="FNanchor_347_348" id="FNanchor_347_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_348" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> They illustrate, what is exceedingly rare in popular
Italian poetry, both the subject-matter and the manner peculiar to the
Northern Ballad. Let the following verses from <i>La Sposa per Forza</i>
suffice<a name="FNanchor_348_349" id="FNanchor_348_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_349" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>:</p>

<p>Other versions of the same poem occur in the dialects of Venice, Como
and Lecco with such variations as prove them all to be the offshoots
from some original now lost in great antiquity. That it existed and was
famous so far back as the middle of the seventeenth century, is proved
by an allusion in the <i>Cicalata in lode della Padella e della Frittura</i>,
recited before the Accademia della Crusca by Lorenzo Panciatichi in
1656.<a name="FNanchor_352_353" id="FNanchor_352_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_353" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> A few lines are also quoted in the <i>incatenatura</i> of the

<p>It is worth mentioning that the same Ballad belongs under slightly

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">The</span> history of popular religious poetry takes us back to the first age
of Italian literature and to the discords of the thirteenth century. All
Italy had been torn asunder by the internecine struggle of Frederick II.
with Innocent III. and Gregory IX. The people saw the two chiefs of
Christendom at open warfare, exchanging anathemas, and doing each what
in him lay to render peace and amity impossible. Milan resounded to the
shrieks of <i>paterini</i>, burned upon the public square by order of an
intolerant pontiff. Padua echoed with the groans of Ezzelino's victims,
doomed to death by hundreds and by thousands in his dun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">-280-</a></span>geons, or cast
forth maimed and mutilated to perish in the fields. The southern
provinces swarmed with Saracens, whom an infidel Emperor had summoned to
his aid against a fanatical Pope. It seemed as though the age, which had
witnessed the assertion of Italian independence and the growth of the
free cities, was about to end in a chaos of bloodshed, fire and frantic
cruelty. The climax of misery and fury was reached in the Crusade
launched by Alexander IV. against the tyrants of the Trevisan Marches.
When Ezzelino died like a dog in 1259, the maddened populace believed
that his demon had now been loosed from chains of flesh, and sent forth
to the elements to work its will in freedom. The prince of darkness was
abroad and menacing. Though the monster had perished, the myth of evil
that survived him had power to fascinate, and was intolerable.</p>

<p>The conscience of the people, crazed by the sight of such iniquity and
suffering, bereft of spiritual guidance, abandoned to bad government,
made itself suddenly felt in an indescribable movement of religious
terror. &quot;In the year 1260,&quot; wrote the Chronicler of Padua,<a name="FNanchor_358_359" id="FNanchor_358_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_359" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> &quot;when
Italy was defiled by many horrible crimes, a sudden and new perturbation
seized at first upon the folk of Perugia, next upon the Romans, and
lastly on the population of all Italy, who, stung by the fear of God,
went forth processionally, gentle and base-born, old and young,
together, through the city streets and squares, naked save for a
waist-band round their loins, holding a whip of leather in their hands,
with tears and groans, scourging their shoulders till the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">-281-</a></span> flowed
down. Not by day alone, but through the night in the intense cold of
winter, with lighted torches they roamed by hundreds, by thousands, by
tens of thousands, through the churches, and flung themselves down
before the altars, led by priests with crosses and banners. The same
happened in all villages and hamlets, so that the fields and mountains
resounded with the cries of sinners calling upon God. All instruments of
music and songs of love were hushed; only the dismal wail of penitents
was heard in town and country.&quot;</p>

<p>It will be noticed that this fanaticism of the Flagellants began among
the Umbrian highlands, the home of S. Francis and the center of
pietistic art, where the passions of the people have ever been more
quickly stirred by pathos than elsewhere in Italy. The <i>Battuti</i>, as
they were called, formed no mere sect. Populations of whole cities,
goaded by an irresistible impulse, which had something of the Dionysiac
madness in it, went forth as though a migration of the race had been
initiated. Blind instinct, the intoxication of religious frenzy, urged
them restlessly and aimlessly from place to place. They had no Holy
Land, no martyr's shrine, in view. Only the ineffable horror of a coming
judgment, only the stings of spiritual apprehension, the fierce craving
after sympathy in common acts of delirium, the allurements of an
exaltation shared by thousands, drove them on, lugubrious herds, like
M&#230;nads of the wrath of God. This insurgence of all classes, swelling
upward from the lowest, gaining the middle regions, and confounding the
highest in the flood of one promiscuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">-282-</a></span> multitude, threatened the very
fabric of society.<a name="FNanchor_359_360" id="FNanchor_359_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_360" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> Repentance and compunction, exhibited upon a
scale of such colossal magnitude, attended by incidents of such
impassioned frenzy, assumed the aspect of vice and of insanity. Florence
shut her gates to the half-naked <i>Battuti</i>. At Milan the tyrants of the
Della Torre blood raised 600 gibbets as a warning. Manfred drew a
military cordon round his southern States to save them from contagion.
The revival was diagnosed by cold observers as an epidemic, or as a
craving akin to that which sets in motion droves of bisons on a
trackless plain. It needed drastic measures of Draconian justice to curb
a disease which threatened the whole nation. Gradually, the first fury
of this fanatical enthusiasm subsided. It was but the symptom of moral
and intellectual bewilderment, of what the French would call
<i>ahurissement</i>, in a race of naturally firm and patient fiber. Yet, when
it passed, durable traces of the agitation remained. Lay fraternities
were formed, not only in Umbria and Tuscany, but in almost all provinces
of the peninsula, who called themselves <i>Disciplinati di Ges&#249; Cristo</i>.
These societies aimed at continuing the ascetic practices of the
Flagellants, and at prolonging their passion of penitence in a more
sober spirit. Scourging formed an essential part of their observances,
but it was used with decency and moderation. Their constitution was
strictly democratic, within limits sanctioned by the clergy. They
existed for the people, supplementing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">-283-</a></span> and not superseding the offices
of the Church. From the date of their foundation they seem to have paid
much attention to the recitation of hymns in the vernacular. These hymns
were called <i>Laude</i>. Written for and by the people, they were
distinguished from the Latin hymns of the Church by greater spontaneity
and rudeness. No limit of taste or literary art was set to the
expression of a fervent piety. The Lauds dwelt chiefly on the Passion of
our Lord, and were used as a stimulus to compunction. In course of time
this part of their system became so prominent that the <i>Battuti</i> or
<i>Disciplinati</i> acquired the milder title of <i>Laudesi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_360_361" id="FNanchor_360_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_361" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>From the <i>Laudesi</i> of the fourteenth century rose one great lyric poet,
Jacopone da Todi, whose hymns embrace the whole gamut of religious
passion, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">-284-</a></span> tender emotions of love to somber anticipations of death
and thrilling visions of judgment. Reading him, we listen to the true
lyrical cry of the people's heart in its intolerance of self-restraint,
blending the language of erotic ecstasy with sobs and sighs of
soul-consuming devotion, aspiring to heaven on wings sped by the energy
of human desire. The flight of his inebriated piety transcends and
out-soars the strongest pinion of ecclesiastical hymnology. Such lines

<p>do but supply the theme for Jacopone's descant. Violently discordant
notes clash and mingle in his chords, and are resolved in bursts of
ardor bordering on delirium. He leaps from the grotesque of plebeian
imagery to pictures of sublime pathos, from incoherent gaspings to
sentences pregnant with shrewd knowledge of the heart, by sudden and
spontaneous transitions, which reveal the religious sentiment in its
simplest form, unspoiled by dogma, unstiffened by scholasticism. None,
for example, but a true child of the people could have found the

<p>In order to understand Jacopone da Todi and to form any true conception
of the medium from which his poems sprang, it is necessary to study the
legend of his life, which, though a legend, bears upon its face the
stamp of truth. It is an offshoot from the Saga of S. Francis, a vivid
utterance of the times which gave it birth.<a name="FNanchor_362_363" id="FNanchor_362_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_363" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Jacopone was born at
Todi, one of those isolated ancient cities which rear themselves upon
their hill-tops between the valleys of the Nera and the Tiber, on the
old post-road from Narni to Perugia. He belonged to the family of the
Benedetti, who were reckoned among the noblest of the district. In his
youth he followed secular studies, took the degree of Doctor of Laws,
and practiced with a keen eye for gain and with not less, his biographer
hints, than the customary legal indifference for justice. He married a
beautiful young wife, whom he dressed splendidly and sent among his
equals to all places of medieval amusement. She was, however, inwardly
religious. The spirit of S. Francis had passed over her; and un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">-286-</a></span>known to
all the crowd around her, unknown to her husband, she practiced the
extremities of ascetic piety. One day she went, at her husband's
bidding, to a merry-making of the nobles of Todi; and it so happened
that &quot;while she was dancing and taking pleasure with the rest, an
accident occurred, fit to move the greatest pity. For the platform
whereupon the party were assembled, fell in and was broken to pieces,
causing grievous injury to those who stood upon it. She was so hurt in
the fall that she lost the power of speech, and in a few hours after
died. Jacopo, who by God's mercy was not there, no sooner heard the sad
news of his wife than he ran to the place. He found her on the point of
death, and sought, as is usual in those cases, to unlace her; but she,
though she could not speak, offered resistance to her husband's unlacing
her. However, he used force and overcame her, and unlaced and carried
her to his house. There, when she had died, he unclothed her with his
own hands, and found that underneath those costly robes and next to her
naked flesh she wore a hair-shirt of the roughest texture. Jacopone, who
up to now had believed his wife, since she was young and beautiful, to
be like other women, worldly and luxurious, stood as it were astonished
and struck dumb when he beheld a thing so contrary to his opinion.
Wherefore from that time forward he went among men like to one who is
stunned, and appeared no longer to be a reasonable man as theretofore.
The cause of this his change to outward view was not a sudden infirmity
of health, or extraordinary sorrow for the cruel death of his wife, or
any such-like occur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">-287-</a></span>rence, but an overwhelming compunction of the heart
begotten in him by this ensample, and a new recognition of what he was
and of his own wretchedness. Wherefore turning back to his own heart,
and reckoning with bitterness the many years that had been spent so
badly, and seeing the peril in which he had continued up to that time,
he set himself to change the manner of his life, and even as he had
lived heretofore wholly for the world, so now he resolved to live wholly
for Christ.&quot;</p>

<p>Jacopone's biographer goes on to tell us how, after this shock, he
became an altered man. He sold all his goods and gave away his substance
to the poor, retaining nothing for himself, but seeking by every device
within his power to render himself vile and ridiculous in the eyes of
men. At one time he stripped himself naked, and put upon his back the
trappings of an ass, and so appeared among the gentles of his earlier
acquaintance. On another occasion he entered a company of merry-making
folk in his brother's house without clothes, smeared with turpentine and
rolled in feathers like a bird.<a name="FNanchor_363_364" id="FNanchor_363_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_364" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> By these mad pranks he acquired the
reputation of one half-witted, and the people called him Jacopone
instead of Messer Jacopo de' Benedetti. Yet there was a keen spirit
living in the man, who had determined literally to become a fool for
Christ's sake. A citizen once bought a fowl and bade Jacopone carry it
to his house. Jacopone took the bird and placed it in the man's family
vault, where it was found. To all remonstrances he answered with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">-288-</a></span>
solemnity which inspired terror, that <i>there</i> was the citizen's real
home. At the end of ten years spent in self-abasement of this sort,
Jacopone entered the lowest rank of the Franciscan brotherhood. The
composition of a Laud so full of spiritual fire that its inspiration
seemed indubitable, won for the apparent madman this grace. There was
something noble in his bearing, even though his actions and his
utterance proved his brain distempered. No fear of hell nor hope of
heaven, says his biographer, but God's infinite goodness and beauty
impelled him to embrace the monastic life and to subject himself to the
severest discipline. Meditating on the Divine perfection, he came to
regard himself as &quot;entirely hideous, vile and stinking, beyond the most
abominable carrion.&quot; It was part of his religious exaltation to prove
this to himself by ghastly penances, instead of seeking to render his
body a fit temple for God's spirit by healthy and clean living. He had a
carnal partiality for liver; and in order to mortify this vile affection
he procured the liver of a beast and hung it in his cell. It became
putrid, swarmed with vermin, and infected the convent with its stench.
The friars discovered Jacopone rejoicing in the sight and odor of this
corruption. With sound good sense they then condemned him to
imprisonment in the common privies; but he rejoiced in this punishment,
and composed one of his most impassioned odes in that foul place. Still,
though he was clearly mad, he had the soul of a Christian and a poet.
His ecstasies were not always repugnant to our sense of delicacy.
Contemplating the wounds of Christ, it entered into his heart to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">-289-</a></span> desire
all suffering which it could be possible for man to undergo&#8212;the pangs
of all the souls condemned to purgatory, the torments of all the damned
in hell, the infinite anguish of all the devils&#8212;if only by this bearing
of the pains of others he might be made like Christ, and go at length,
the last of all the world, to Paradise. Not only the passion but the
love of Jesus inflamed him with indescribable raptures. He spent whole
days in singing, weeping, groaning, and ejaculation. &quot;He ran,&quot; says the
biographer, &quot;in a fury of love, and under the impression that he was
embracing and clasping Jesus Christ, would fling his arms about a tree.&quot;
It is not possible to imagine more potent workings of religious insanity
in a distempered and at the same time nobly-gifted character. That
obscene antipathy to nature which characterized medieval asceticism,
becomes poetic in a lunatic of genius like Jacopone. Nor was his natural
acumen blunted. He discerned how far the Papacy diverged from
Christianity in practice, and assailed Boniface VIII. with bitterest
invectives. Among other prophetic sayings ascribed to him, we find this,
which corresponds most nearly to the truth of history: &quot;Pope Boniface,
like a fox thou didst enter on the Papacy, like a wolf thou reignest,
and like a dog shalt thou depart from it.&quot; For his free speech Boniface
had him sent to prison; and in his dungeon, rejoicing, Jacopone composed
the finest of his Canticles.</p>

<p>Such was the man who struck the key-note of religious popular poetry in
Italy, and whose Lauds may be regarded as the germ of a voluminous
literature. Passing from his life to his writings, it will suffice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">-290-</a></span>
give a few specimens of those hymns which are most characteristic of his
temper. We have already seen how he brought together the most repulsive
details of disease, in order to express his desire to suffer with
Christ.<a name="FNanchor_364_365" id="FNanchor_364_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_365" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Here is the beginning of a canticle in praise of the

<p>Upon this note of anguish the poem closes. It is conducted throughout in
dialogue, and is penetrated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">-295-</a></span> dramatic energy. For Passion Music of
a noble and yet flowing type, such as Pergolese might have composed, it
is still admirably adapted.</p>

<p>Each strophe of Fra Jacopone's Canticles might be likened to a seed cast
into the then fertile soil of the Franciscan Order, which bore fruit a
thousand-fold in its own kind of spiritual poetry. The vast collection
of hymns, published by Tresatti in the seventeenth century, bears the
name of Jacopone, and incorporates his genuine compositions.<a name="FNanchor_371_372" id="FNanchor_371_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_372" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> But we
must regard the main body of the work as rather belonging to Jacopone's
school than to the master. Taken collectively, these poems bear upon
their face the stamp of considerable age, and there is no reason to
suppose that their editor doubted of their authenticity. A critical
reader of the present time, however, discerns innumerable evidences of
collaboration, and detects expansion and dilution of more pregnant
themes in the copious outpourings of this cloistral inspiration. What
the Giotteschi are to Giotto, Tresatti's collection is to Salviano's
imprint of Jacopone. It forms a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">-296-</a></span> complete manual of devotion, framed
according to the spirit of S. Francis. In its pages we read the progress
of the soul from a state of worldliness and vice, through moral virtue,
into the outer court of religious conviction. Thence we pass to
penitence and the profound terror of sin. Having traversed the region of
purgatory upon earth, we are introduced to the theory of Divine Love,
which is reasoned out and developed upon themes borrowed from each
previous step gained by the spirit in its heavenward journey. Here ends
the soul's novitiate; and we enter on a realm of ecstasy. The poet
bathes in an illimitable ocean of intoxicating love, summons the images
of sense and makes them adumbrate his rapture of devotion, reproducing
in a myriad modes the Oriental metaphors of the soul's marriage to
Christ suggested by the Canticle of Canticles. A final grade in this
ascent to spiritual perfection is attained in the closing odes, which
celebrate annihilation&#8212;the fusion of the mortal in immortal
personality, the bliss of beatific vision, Nirvana realized on earth in
ecstasy by man. At this final point sense swoons, the tongue stammers,
language refuses to perform her office, the reason finds no place, the
universe is whirled in spires of flame, we float in waves of metaphor,
we drown in floods of contemplation, the whole is closed with an <i>O
Altitudo!</i></p>

<p>It is not possible to render scantiest justice to this extraordinary
monument of the Franciscan fervor by any extracts or descriptions. Its
full force can only be felt by prolonged and, if possible, continuous
perusal. S. Catherine and S. Teresa attend us while we read; and when
the book is finished, we feel, perhaps for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">-297-</a></span> first time, the might,
the majesty, the overmastering attraction of that sea of faith which
swept all Europe in the thirteenth century. We understand how <i>naufragar
in questo mar f&#249; dolce</i>.</p>

<p>Though the task is ungrateful, it behooves the historian of popular
Italian poetry to extract some specimens from this immense repertory of

the flesh, and contempt of the world, I will select one stanza upon

<p>Let this suffice. With the language of sweetness and monastic love we
are soon surfeited. Were it not that the <i>crescendo</i> of erotic
exaltation ends at last in a jubilee of incomprehensible passion,
blending the incoherence of delirium with fragments of theosophy which
might have been imported from old Alexandrian sources or from dim
regions of the East, a student of our century would shrink aghast from
some of these hermaphroditic hymns, as though he had been witness of
wild acts of nympholepsy in a girl he reckoned sane.</p>

<p>Through the two centuries which followed Jacopone's death (1306?) the
Lauds of the Confraternities continued to form a special branch of
popular poetry; and in the fifteenth century they were written in
considerable quantities by men of polite education. Like all hymns,
these spiritual songs are less remarkable for literary quality than
devoutness. It is difficult to find one rising to the height of
Jacopone's inspiration. Many of the later compositions even lack
religious feeling, and seem to have been written as taskwork. Those, for
example, by Lorenzo de' Medici bear the same relation to his <i>Canti
Carnascialeschi</i> as Pontano's odes to the Saints bear to his elegies and
Baian lyrics. This was inevitable in an age saturated with the adverse
ideals of the classical Revival, when Platonic theism threatened to
supplant Christianity, and society was clogged with frigid cynicism. Yet
even in the sixteenth century, those hymns which came directly from the
people's heart, thrilling with the strong vibrations of Savonarola's
preaching, are still remarkable for almost frantic piety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">-303-</a></span> Among the
many Florentine hymn-writers who felt that influence, Girolamo Benivieni
holds the most distinguished place, both for the purity of his style and
for the sincerity of his religious feeling. I will set side by side two
versions from his book of Lauds, illustrating the extreme limits of
devout emotion&#8212;the calmness of a meditative piety and the spasms of
passionate enthusiasm. The first is a little hymn to Jesus, profoundly
felt and expressed with exquisite simplicity<a name="FNanchor_383_384" id="FNanchor_383_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_384" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>:</p>

<p>Many collections of Lauds were early committed to the press; and of
these we have an excellent modern reprint in the <i>Laude spirituali di
Feo Belcari e di altri</i>, which includes hymns by Castellano Castellani,
Bernardo Giambullari, Francesco Albizzi, Lorenzo de' Medici, Lucrezia
Tornabuoni, and the Pulci brothers.<a name="FNanchor_385_386" id="FNanchor_385_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_386" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Studying this miscellany, we
perceive that between the <i>Laude</i> and <i>Ballate</i> of the people there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">-305-</a></span>often little but a formal difference. Large numbers are parodies of
amatory or obscene songs, beginning with nearly the same words and
intended to be sung to the same tunes. Thus the famous ballad, <i>O vaghe
montanine e pastorelle</i> becomes <i>O vaghe di Ges&#249;, o verginelle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_386_387" id="FNanchor_386_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_387" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
The direction for singing <i>Crucifisso a capo chino</i> is <i>Cantasi
come&#8212;Una donna di fino amore</i>, which was a coarse street song in vogue
among the common folk.<a name="FNanchor_387_388" id="FNanchor_387_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_388" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> <i>Vergine, alta regina</i>, is modeled upon
<i>Galantina, morosina</i>; <i>I' son quella pecorella</i> upon <i>I' son quella
villanella</i>; <i>Gi&#249; per la mala via l'anima mia ne va</i> on <i>Gi&#249; per la
villa lunga la bella se ne va</i>.<a name="FNanchor_388_389" id="FNanchor_388_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_389" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Others are imitations of carnival
choruses noted for their grossness and lewd innuendoes.<a name="FNanchor_389_390" id="FNanchor_389_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_390" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> It is clear
that the <i>Laudesi</i>, long before the days of Rowland Hill, discerned the
advantage of not letting the devil have all the good tunes. Other
parallels between the Florentine Lauds and the revival hymns of the
present century might be pointed out. Yet in proportion as the Italian
religious sentiment is more sensuous and erotic than that of the
Teutonic nations, so are the Lauds more unreservedly emotional than the
most audacious utterances of American or English Evangelicalism. As an
excellent Italian critic has recently observed, the amorous and
religious poems of the people were only distinguished by the difference
of their object. Expression, versification, melody, pitch of sentiment,
remained unaltered. &quot;Men sang the same <i>strambotti</i> to the Virgin and
the lady of their love, to the rose <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">-306-</a></span>of Jericho and the red rose of the
balcony.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_390_391" id="FNanchor_390_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_391" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> No notion of impropriety seems to have been suggested by
this confusion of divergent feelings. Otherwise, Savonarola would hardly
have suffered his proselytes to roam the streets chanting stanzas which
are little better than echoes from the brothel or travesties of
Poliziano's chorus of the M&#230;nads. The Italians have never been pious in
the same sense as the Northern nations. Their popular religious poetry
is the lyric of emotion, the lyric of the senses losing self-restraint
in an outpouring of voluptuous ecstasy. With them &quot;music is a
love-lament or a prayer addressed to God;&quot; and both constituents of
music blend and mingle indistinguishably in their hymns. As they lack
the sublime Chorales of the Reformation period in Germany, so they lack
the grave and meditative psalms for which Bach made his melodies.</p>

<p>The origins of the Italian theater were closely connected with the
services of the <i>Laudesi</i>. And here it has to be distinctly pointed out
that the evolution of the Sacred Drama in Italy followed a different
course from that with which we are familiar in France and England.
Miracle-plays and Mysteries, properly so called, do not appear to have
been common among the Italians in the early middle ages. There is,
indeed, one exception to this general statement which warns us to be
cautious, and which proves that the cyclical sacred play had been
exhibited at least in one place at a very early date. At Cividale, in
the district of Friuli, a <i>Ludus Christi</i>, embracing the principal
events of Christian history from the Passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">-307-</a></span> to the Second Advent, was
twice acted, in 1298 and 1303. From the scanty notices concerning it, we
are able to form an opinion that it lasted over three days, that it was
recited by the clergy, almost certainly in Latin, and that the
representation did not take place in church.<a name="FNanchor_391_392" id="FNanchor_391_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_392" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> The Friulian <i>Ludi
Christi</i> were, in fact, a Mystery of the more primitive type,
corresponding to Greban's <i>Myst&#232;re de la Passion</i> and to our Coventry or
Widkirk Miracles. But, so far as present knowledge goes, this sacred
play was an isolated phenomenon, and proved unfruitful of results. We
are only able to infer from it, what the close intercourse of the
Italians with the French would otherwise make evident, that Mysteries
were not entirely unknown in the Peninsula. Yet it seems clear, upon the
other hand, that the two forms of the sacred drama specific to Italy,
the Umbrian <i>Divozione</i> and the Florentine <i>Sacra Rappresentazione</i>,
were not a direct outgrowth from the Mystery. We have to trace their
origin in the religious practices of the <i>Laudesi</i>, from which a species
of dramatic performance was developed, and which placed the sacred drama
in the hands of these lay confraternities.</p>

<p>At first the <i>Disciplinati di Ges&#249;</i> intoned their Lauds in the hall of
the Company, standing before the crucifix or tabernacle of a saint, as
they are represented in old wood-cuts.<a name="FNanchor_392_393" id="FNanchor_392_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_393" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> From simple singing they
passed to antiphonal chanting, and thence made a natural transition to
dialogue, and lastly to dramatic action. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">-308-</a></span>To trace the steps of this
progress is by no means easy; nor must we imagine that it was effected
wholly within the meeting-places of the confraternities without external
influence. Though the Italians may not have brought the Miracle-play to
the perfection it attained among the Northern nations, they were, as we
have seen, undoubtedly aware of its existence. Furthermore, they were
familiar with ecclesiastical shows but little removed in character from
that form of medieval art. Representations of the manger at Bethlehem
made part of Christmas ceremonies in Umbria, as we learn from a passage
in the works of S. Bonaventura referring to the year 1223.<a name="FNanchor_393_394" id="FNanchor_393_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_394" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Nor were
occasions wanting when pageants enlivened the ritual of the Church.
Among liturgical dramas, enacted by priests and choristers at service
time, may be mentioned the descent of the Angel Gabriel at the feast of
the Annunciation, the procession of the Magi at Epiphany, the descent of
the dove at Pentecost, and the Easter representation of a sepulcher from
which the body of Christ had been removed. Thus the <i>Laudesi</i> found
precedents in the Liturgy itself for introducing a dramatic element into
their offices.</p>

<p>Having assumed a more or less dramatic form, the Laud acquired the name
of <i>Divozione</i> as early as the middle of the fourteenth century. It was
written in various lyric meters, beginning with six-lined stanzas in
<i>ottonari</i>, passing through hendecasyllabic <i>sesta rima</i>, and finally
settling down into <i>ottava rima</i>, which became the common stanza for all
forms of popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">-309-</a></span> poetry in the fifteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_394_395" id="FNanchor_394_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_395" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The passion of
our Lord formed the principal theme of the <i>Divozioni</i>; for the
<i>Laudesi</i> were bound by their original constitution to a special
contemplation of His suffering upon the cross for sinners. The Perugian
Chronicles refer to compositions of this type under the name of
<i>Corrotto</i>, or song of mourning. In its highest form it was the
passionate outpouring of Mary's anguish over her crucified Son&#8212;the
counterpart in poetry to the <i>Piet&#224;</i> of painting, for which the
Giottesque masters, the Umbrian school, Crivelli, and afterwards
Mantegna, reserved the strongest exhibition of their powers as
dramatists. We have already seen with what a noble and dramatic dialogue
Jacopone da Todi initiated this species of composition.<a name="FNanchor_395_396" id="FNanchor_395_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_396" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> At the same
time, the <i>Divozioni</i> and the Lauds from which they sprang, embraced a
wide variety of subjects, following the passages of Scripture appointed
to be read in church on festivals and Sundays. Thus the Laud for Advent
dramatized the Apocalypse and introduced the episode of Antichrist. The
story of the Prodigal furnished a theme for the vigil when that parable
was used. It was customary to sing these compositions in the oratories
after the discipline of the confraternity had been duly performed; and
that they were sung, is a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">-310-</a></span>fact of importance which must never be
forgotten. Every Company had its own collection of dramatic Lauds,
forming a cycle of sacred melodramas, composed with no literary end and
no theatrical effect in view, but with the simple purpose of expressing
by dialogue the substance of a Scripture narrative.</p>

<p>An inventory of the Perugian Confraternity of S. Domenico, dated in the
year 1339, includes wings and crowns for sixty-eight angels, masks for
devils, a star for the Magi, a crimson robe for Christ, black veils for
the Maries, two lay figures of thieves, a dove to symbolize the Holy
Ghost, a coat of mail for Longinus, and other properties which prove
that not Passion-plays alone but dramas suited to Epiphany, Pentecost
and the Annunciation must have been enacted at that period. Yet we have
no exact means of ascertaining when the <i>Laudesi</i> left their oratories
and began to recite <i>Divozioni</i> with action in church or on the open
square. The Compagnia del Gonfalone are said to have presented a play to
the Roman people in the Coliseum in 1260; but though the brotherhood was
founded in that year, it is more than doubtful whether their famous
Passion dates from so early an epoch.<a name="FNanchor_396_397" id="FNanchor_396_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_397" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> By the year 1375 it had
become customary for <i>Laudesi</i> to give representations in church,
accompanied by a sermon from the pulpit. The audience assembled in the
nave, and a scaffold was erected along the screen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">-311-</a></span> which divided the
nave and transepts from the choir. Here the brethren played their
pieces, while the preacher at appropriate intervals addressed the
people, explaining what they were about to see upon the stage or
commenting on what had been performed.<a name="FNanchor_397_398" id="FNanchor_397_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_398" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> The actors were the Chorus,
the preacher the Choregus. The stage was technically called
<i>talamo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_398_399" id="FNanchor_398_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_399" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> It had a large central compartment, corresponding to the
&quot;Logeion&quot; of the Attic theater, with several smaller rooms termed
<i>luoghi deputati</i>, and galleries above reserved for the celestial
personages. The actors entered from a central and two side doors called
<i>reggi</i>.</p>

<p>These Umbrian <i>Divozioni</i> form a link between the Laud of the thirteenth
and the <i>Sacra Rappresentazione</i> of the fifteenth century. They
still&#8212;in form at least, if not in sacred character&#8212;survive in the
<i>Maggi</i> of the Tuscan peasantry, which are yearly acted among the
villages of the Lucchese and Pistojese highlands.<a name="FNanchor_399_400" id="FNanchor_399_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_400" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> It is difficult
to say how far we are justified in regarding them as wholly different in
type from the Northern Miracle-plays. That they originated in the
oratories of lay brotherhoods, and that they retained the character of
Lauds to be sung after they had assumed dramatic shape, may be reckoned
as established points. Moreover, they lack the cyclical extension and
the copious admixture of grotesquely comic elements which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">-312-</a></span>mark the
French and English Mysteries. Yet we have already seen that such
Mysteries were not entirely unknown in Italy, and that the liturgical
drama, performed by ecclesiastics, had been from early times a part of
Church ceremonial on holy days. We are, therefore, justified in
accepting the <i>Divozioni</i> as the Italian species of a genus which was
common to the medieval nations. The development of Gothic architecture
in Central Italy might furnish an illustration. Its differentiation from
the grander and more perfect type of French and English Gothic does not
constitute a separate style.</p>

<p>To bridge the interval between the <i>Divozione</i>, used in Umbria, and the
<i>Sacra Rappresentazione</i>, as it appeared at Florence, is rendered
impossible by the present lack of documents. Still there seems
sufficient reason to believe that the latter was evolved from the former
within the precincts of the confraternities. In the <i>Sacra
Rappresentazione</i> the religious drama of Italy reached its highest point
of development, and produced a form of art peculiar to Florence and the
Tuscan cities. Though it betrays certain affinities to the Northern
Miracle-play, which prove familiarity with the French <i>Myst&#232;res</i> on the
part at least of some among the playwrights, it is clearly a distinct
kind. As in the case of the Umbrian <i>Divozioni</i>, so here the absence of
grotesque episodes is striking; nor do we find connected series of
<i>Sacre Rappresentazioni</i>, embracing the Christian history in a cyclical
dramatic work. This species flourished for about fifty years, from 1470
to 1520. These dates are given approximately; for though we know that
the Sacred Drama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">-313-</a></span> of Florence did not long survive the second decade of
the sixteenth century, we cannot ascertain the period of its origin. The
<i>Sacre Rappresentazioni</i> we possess in print, almost all written within
the last thirty years of the fifteenth century, present so marked a
similarity of style and structure that they must have been preceded by a
series of experiments which fixed and conventionalized their form. Like
the <i>Divozioni</i>, they were in the hands of confraternities, who caused
them to be acted at their own expense. Since these Companies were
wealthy, and included members of the best Florentine families, their
plays were put upon the stage with pomp. The actors were boys belonging
to the brotherhoods, directed by a Chorodidascalus called <i>Festajuolo</i>.
S. Antonino, the good archbishop, promoted the custom of enrolling
youths of all classes in religious Companies, seeking by such influences
to encourage sound morality and sober living. The most fashionable
brotherhoods were those of San Bastiano or Del Freccione, Del Vangelista
or Dell'Aquila, Dell'Arcangelo Raffaello or Della Scala&#8212;the name of the
saint or his ensign being indifferently used. Representations took place
either in the oratory of the Company, or in the refectory of a convent.
Meadows at Fiesole and public squares were also chosen for open-air
performances.<a name="FNanchor_400_401" id="FNanchor_400_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_401" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> The <i>libretti</i> were composed in octave stanzas, with
passages of <i>terza rima</i>, and were sung to a recitative air. Interludes
of part-songs, with accompani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">-314-</a></span>ment of lute and viol, enlivened the
simple <i>cantilena</i>; and there is no doubt, from contemporary notices,
that this music was of the best. The time selected was usually after
vespers. The audience were admitted free of cost, but probably by
invitation only to the friends and relatives of the young actors. <i>Sacra
Rappresentazione</i> was the generic name of the show; but we meet with
these subordinate titles, <i>Festa</i>, <i>Mistero</i>, <i>Storia</i>, <i>Vangelo</i>,
<i>Figura</i>, <i>Esemplo</i>, <i>Passione</i>, <i>Martirio</i>, <i>Miracolo</i>, according to
the special subject-matter of the play in question.</p>

<p>D'Ancona, in his book on the Origins of the Italian Drama, suggests that
the <i>Sacre Rappresentazioni</i> were developed by a blending of the Umbrian
<i>Divozioni</i> with the civic pageants of S. John's day at Florence. This
theory is plausible enough to deserve investigation; especially as many
points relating to the nature of the performances will be elucidated in
the course of the inquiry. We must, however, be cautious not to take for
granted that D'Ancona's conclusions have been proved. The researches of
that eminent literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">-315-</a></span> antiquarian, in combination with those made by
Professor Monaci, are but just beginning to throw light on this hitherto
neglected topic.</p>

<p>From the Chroniclers of the fifteenth century we have abundant testimony
that in all parts of Italy sacred and profane shows formed a prominent
feature of municipal festivals, and were exhibited by the burghers of
the cities when they wished to welcome a distinguished foreigner, or to
celebrate the election of their chief magistrates.<a name="FNanchor_401_402" id="FNanchor_401_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_402" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Thus Sigismund,
King of the Romans, was greeted at Lucca in 1432 by a solemn triumph.
Perugia gratified Eugenius IV. in 1444 with the story of the Minotaur,
the tragedy of Iphigenia, the Nativity and the Ascension.<a name="FNanchor_402_403" id="FNanchor_402_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_403" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> The
popular respect for S. Bernardino found expression at Siena in a
pageant, when the Papal Curia, in 1450, issued letters for his
canonization.<a name="FNanchor_403_404" id="FNanchor_403_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_404" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Frederick III. was received in 1452 at Naples with
the spectacle of the Passion. Leonora of Aragon, on her way through Rome
in 1473 to Ferrara, witnessed a series of pantomimes, profane and
sacred, splendidly provided by Pietro Riario, the Cardinal of San
Sisto.<a name="FNanchor_404_405" id="FNanchor_404_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_405" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> The triumphs of the Popes on entering office filled the
streets of Rome with dramatic exhibitions, indifferently borrowed from
Biblical and classic history. At Parma in 1414 the students celebrated
the election of Andrea di Sicilia to a chair in their university by a
procession <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">-316-</a></span>of the Magi.<a name="FNanchor_405_406" id="FNanchor_405_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_406" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> When the head of S. Andrew entered Rome in
1462, the citizens and prelates testified their joy with figurative
pomps.<a name="FNanchor_406_407" id="FNanchor_406_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_407" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Viterbo in the same year enjoyed a variety of splendid
exhibitions, Cardinal vying with Cardinal in magnificence, upon the
festival of Corpus Domini.<a name="FNanchor_407_408" id="FNanchor_407_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_408" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>The pageants above-mentioned formed but prolusions to the yearly feast
of S. John at Florence.<a name="FNanchor_408_409" id="FNanchor_408_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_409" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> Florence had, as it were, the monopoly of
such shows; and we know from many sources that Florentine artists were
employed in distant cities for the preparation of spectacles which they
had brought to perfection in their own town. An extract from Matteo
Palmieri's Chronicle, referring to the year 1454, brings this Midsummer
rejoicing vividly before the reader's mind.<a name="FNanchor_409_410" id="FNanchor_409_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_410" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> It is an accurate
description of the order followed at that period in the exhibition of
pantomimic pageants by the guilds and merchants of the town. &quot;On the 22d
day of June the Cross of S. Maria del Fiore moved first, with all the
clergy and children, and behind them seven singing men. Then the
Companies of James the wool-shearer and Nofri the shoe-maker, with some
thirty boys in white and angels. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">-317-</a></span>Thirdly, the Tower (<i>edifizio</i>) of S.
Michael, whereupon stood God the Father in a cloud (<i>nuvola</i>); and on
the Piazza, before the Signoria, they gave the show (<i>rappresentazione</i>)
of the Battle of the Angels, when Lucifer was cast out of heaven.
Fourthly, the Company of Ser Antonio and Piero di Mariano, with some
thirty boys clothed in white and angels. Fifthly, the Tower of Adam, the
which on the Piazza gave the show of how God created Adam and Eve, with
the Temptation by the serpent and all thereto pertaining. Sixthly, a
Moses upon horseback, attended by many mounted men of the chiefs in
Israel and others. Seventhly, the Tower of Moses, which upon the Piazza
gave the show of the Delivery of the Law. Eighthly, many Prophets and
Sibyls, including Hermes Trismegistus and others who foretold the
Incarnation of our Lord.&quot; With this list Palmieri proceeds at great
length, reckoning in all twenty-two Towers. The procession, it seems,
stopped upon its passage to exhibit tableaux; and these were so arranged
that the whole Scripture history was set forth in dumb show, down to the
Last Day. The representation of each tableau and the moving of the
pageant through the streets and squares of Florence lasted sixteen
hours. It will be observed that, here at least, a cyclical exposition of
Christian doctrine, corresponding to the comprehensive Mysteries of the
North, was attempted in pantomime. The Towers, we may remark in passing,
were wooden cars, surmounted with appropriate machinery, on which the
actors sat and grouped themselves according to their subject. They
differed in no essentials from the Triumphal Chariots of carnival time,
as described by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">-318-</a></span> Vasari in his Lives of Piero di Cosimo and Pontormo.
From an anonymous Greek writer who visited Florence in the train of John
Pal&#230;ologus, we gather some notion of the effect produced upon a stranger
by these pageants.<a name="FNanchor_410_411" id="FNanchor_410_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_411" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> He describes the concourse of the Florentines,
and gives the measure of his own astonishment by saying: &quot;They work
prodigies in this feast, and miracles, or at least the representation of
miracles.&quot;</p>

<p>Vasari in his life of Il Cecca contributes much valuable information
concerning the machinery used in the shows of S. John's Day.<a name="FNanchor_411_412" id="FNanchor_411_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_412" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> The
Piazza of the Duomo was covered in with a broad blue awning&#8212;similar, we
may suppose, to that veil of deeper and lighter azure bands which forms
the background to Fra Lippi's &quot;Crowning of the Virgin.&quot; This was sown
with golden lilies, and was called a Heaven. Beneath it were the clouds,
or <i>Nuvole</i>, exhibited by various civic guilds. They were constructed of
substantial wooden frames, supporting an almond-shaped aureole, which
was thickly covered with wool, and surrounded with lights and cherub
faces. Inside it sat the person who represented the saint, just as
Christ and Madonna are represented in the pictures of the Umbrian
school. Lower down, projected branches made of iron, bearing children
dressed like angels, and secured by waist-bands in the same way as the
fairies of our transformation scenes. The wood-work and the wires were
hidden from sight by wool and cloth, plentifully <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">-319-</a></span>sprinkled with tinsel
stars. The whole moved slowly on the backs of bearers concealed beneath
the frame. Vasari attributes the first invention of these and similar
<i>ingegni</i> to Filippo Brunelleschi. Their similarity to what we know
about the <i>pegmata</i> of Roman triumphs, renders this assertion probable.
Brunelleschi's study of ancient art may have induced him to adapt a
classical device to the requirements of Christian pageantry. When
designed on a colossal scale and stationary, these <i>Nuvole</i> were known
by the name of <i>Paradiso</i>. Another prominent feature in the Midsummer
Show was the procession of giants and giantesses mounted upon stilts,
and hooded with fantastic masks. Men marched in front, holding a pike to
balance these unwieldy creatures; but Vasari states that some
specialists in this craft were able to walk the streets on stilts six
cubits high, without assistance. Then there were <i>spiritelli</i>&#8212;lighter
and winged beings, raised aloft to the same height, and shining down
like genii from their giddy altitude in sunlight on the crowd.</p>

<p>Whether we are right or not in assuming with D'Ancona that the <i>Sacra
Rappresentazione</i> was a hybrid between the Umbrian <i>Divozione</i> and these
pageants, there is no doubt that the Florentine artists, and
<i>Ingegnieri</i>, were equal to furnishing the stage with richness. The
fraternities spared no expense, but secured the services of the best
designers. They also employed versifiers of repute to compose their
libretti. It must be remembered that these texts were written for boys,
and were meant to be acted by boys. Thus there came into existence a
peculiar type of sacred drama, displaying something childish in its
style, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">-320-</a></span> taxing the ingenuity of scene-painters, mechanicians,
architects, musicians, and poets, to produce a certain calculated
theatrical effect. When we remember how these kindred arts flourished in
the last decades of the fifteenth century, we are justified in believing
that the <i>Sacre Rappresentazioni</i> offered a spectacle no less beautiful
than curious and rare.</p>

<p>An examination of a few of these plays in detail will help us to
understand one of the most original products of the popular Italian
literature. With this object, I propose to consider the three volumes of
reprints, edited with copious illustrations by Professor Alessandro
d'Ancona.<a name="FNanchor_412_413" id="FNanchor_412_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_413" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> But before proceeding to render an account of the
forty-three plays included in this collection, it will be well to give
some notice of the men who wrote them, to describe their general
character, and to explain the manner of their presentation on the stage.</p>

<p>The authors of <i>Sacre Rappresentazioni</i> are frequently anonymous; but
Lorenzo de' Medici, Antonio Alamanni, Bernardo Pulci and his wife Monna
Antonia contribute each a sacred drama. The best were written by Feo
Belcari and Castellano Castellani. Of the latter very little is known,
except that in the year 1517 he exercised the priestly functions at
Florence and was a prolific writer of Lauds. Feo Belcari, a Florentine
citizen, born in 1410, held civic offices of distinction during the
ascendency of Casa Medici. He was a man of birth and some learning, who
devoted himself to the production of literature in prose and verse
intended for popular edification. His Lauds are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">-321-</a></span> among the best which
have descended from the fifteenth century, and his translation of the
Lives of the Fathers into Tuscan is praised for purity of style. When he
died, in 1484, &quot;poor, weak, and white-haired,&quot; Girolamo Benivieni, the
disciple of Savonarola and the greatest sacred singer of that age,
composed his elegy in verses of mingled sweetness and fervor<a name="FNanchor_413_414" id="FNanchor_413_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_414" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>:</p>

<p>As regards their form, the <i>Sacre Rappresentazioni</i> are never divided
into acts; but the copious stage-directions prove that the scenes were
shifted, and in one or two instances secular interludes are introduced
in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">-322-</a></span> pauses of the action.<a name="FNanchor_414_415" id="FNanchor_414_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_415" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> The drama follows the tale or legend
without artistic structure of plot; nor do the authors appear to have
aimed, except in subordinate episodes, at much development of character.
What they found ready to their hand in prose, they versified. The same
fixed personages, and the same traditional phrases recur with singular
monotony, proving that a conventional framework and style had become
stereotyped. The end in view was religious edification. Therefore mere
types of virtue in saints and martyrs, types of wickedness in tyrants
and persecutors, sufficed alike for authors, actors, and audience. True
dramatic genius emerges only in the minor parts, where a certain freedom
of handling and effort after character-drawing are discernible. The
success of the play depended on the movement of the story, and the
attractions of the scenery, costumes and music. It was customary for an
angel to prologize and to dismiss the audience<a name="FNanchor_415_416" id="FNanchor_415_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_416" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>; but his place is
once at least taken by a young man with a lute.<a name="FNanchor_416_417" id="FNanchor_416_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_417" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> A more dramatic
opening was occasionally attempted in a conversation between two boys of
Florence, the one good and the other bad; and instead of the <i>licenza</i>
the scene sometimes closed with a <i>Te Deum</i>, or a Laud sung by the
actors <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">-323-</a></span>and probably taken up by the spectators. Castellani in his
<i>Figliuol Prodigo</i> made good use of the dramatic opening, gradually
working the matter of his play out of a dialogue which begins with a
smart interchange of Florentine chaff.<a name="FNanchor_417_418" id="FNanchor_417_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_418" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> It would be useless even to
attempt a translation of this scene. The raciness of its obsolete
street-slang would evaporate, and the fiber of the piece is not strong
enough to bear rude handling. It must suffice to indicate its rare
dramatic quality. Students of our own Elizabethan literature may
profitably compare this picture of manners with similar passages in
<i>Hycke Scorner</i> or <i>Lusty Juventus</i>. But the Florentine interlude is
more fairly representative of actual life than any part of our
Moralities. Castellani's Prodigal Son, however, rises altogether to a
higher artistic level than the ordinary; and the same may be said about
the <i>Miracolo di S. Maria Maddalena</i>, where a simple dramatic motive is
interwoven with the action of the whole piece and made to supply a
proper ending.<a name="FNanchor_418_419" id="FNanchor_418_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_419" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>As a rule, the <i>Sacre Rappresentazioni</i> partook of the character of a
religious service. Their tone is uniformly pious. Yet the spirit of the
age and the nature of the Italians were alike unfavorable to piety of a
true temper. Here it is unctuous, caressing, sentimental&#8212;anything but
vigorous or virile. The monastic virtues are highly extolled; and an
unwholesome view of life seen from the cloister by some would-be saint,
who &quot;winks and shuts his apprehension up&quot; to common facts of experience,
is too often presented. Vice is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">-324-</a></span>sincerely condemned; yet the morality
of these exhibitions cannot be applauded. Instead of the stern lessons
of humanity conveyed in a drama like that of Athens or of England, the
precepts of the pulpit and confessional are enforced with a childish
simplicity that savors more of cloistral pietism than of true knowledge
of the world. Mere belief in the intercession of saints and the efficacy
of relics is made to cover all crimes; while the anti-social enthusiasms
of dreamy boys and girls are held up for imitation. We feel that we are
reading what a set of feeble spiritual directors wrote with a touch of
conscious but well-meaning insincerity for children. The glaring
contrast between the professed asceticism of the fraternities and the
future conduct of their youthful members in the world of the Renaissance
leaves a suspicion of hypocrisy.<a name="FNanchor_419_420" id="FNanchor_419_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_420" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> This impression is powerfully
excited by Lorenzo de' Medici's <i>Rappresentazione di S. Giovanni e
Paolo</i>, which was acted by his children. The tone is not, indeed, so
unctuous as that of Castellani. Yet when we remember what manner of man
was Lorenzo; when we reflect what parts were played by his sons, Piero
and Leo X., upon the stage of Italy; the sanctimonious tone of its
frigid octave stanzas fails to impose on our credulity.</p>

<p>An adequate notion of the scenic apparatus of the <i>Rappresentazioni</i> may
be gathered from the stage-directions to <i>S. Uliva</i> and from the
interludes described in Giovanmaria Cecchi's <i>Esaltazione della
Croce</i>.<a name="FNanchor_420_421" id="FNanchor_420_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_421" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> The latter piece was acted in Florence on the occasion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">-325-</a></span>Ferrando de' Medici's marriage to Cristina of Lorraine, in 1589. It
belongs, therefore, to the very last of these productions. Yet, judging
by Vasari's account of the <i>Ingegni</i>, we may assume that the style of
presentation was traditional, and that a Florentine Company of the
fifteenth century might have put a play upon the stage with at least
equal pomp. The prose description of the apparatus and the interludes
reads exactly like the narrative portion of Ben Jonson's Masks at Court,
in which the poet awards due praise to the &quot;design and invention&quot; of
Master Inigo Jones and to the millinery of Signor Forobosco.<a name="FNanchor_421_422" id="FNanchor_421_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_422" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> It was
indeed, a custom derived by England from Italy for the poet to set forth
a minute record of his own designs together with their execution by the
co-operating architects, scene-painters, musicians, dress-makers, and
morris-dancers. The architect, says Cecchi, was one Taddeo di Leonardo
Landini, a member of the Compagnia, skilled in sculpture as well as an
excellent machinist. He arranged the field, or <i>prato</i>, of the Compagnia
di S. Giovanni in the form of a theater, covered with a red tent, and
painted with pictures of the Cross considered as an instrument of
shameful death, as a precious relic, and as the reward of virtue in this
life. Emblems, scrolls and heraldic achievements completed the adornment
of the theater. When the curtain rose for the first time, Jacob was seen
in a meadow, &quot;asleep with his head on certain stones, dressed in costly
furs slung across his shoulder, with a thin shirt of fine linen beneath,
cloth-of-silver stockings and fair buskins on his feet, and in his hand
a gilt wand.&quot; While he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">-326-</a></span> slept, heaven opened, and seven angels appeared
seated upon clouds, and making &quot;a most pleasant noise with horns,
greater and less viols, lutes and organ ... the music of this and all
the other interludes was the composition of Luca Bati, a man in this art
most excellent.&quot; When they had played and sung, the cloud disclosed, and
showed a second heaven, where sat God the Father.<a name="FNanchor_422_423" id="FNanchor_422_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_423" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> All the angels
worshiped Him, and heaven increased in splendor. Then a ladder was let
down, and God, leaning upon it, turned to Jacob and &quot;sang majestically
to the sound of many instruments, in a sonorous bass voice.&quot; Thereupon
angels descended and ascended by the ladder, singing a hymn in honor of
the Cross; and at last the clouds closed round, heaven disappeared and
Jacob woke from sleep. Such was the introduction to the drama. Between
the first and second acts was shown, with no less exuberance of scenical
resources, the exodus of Israel from Egypt; between the second and
third, the miracle of Aaron's rod that blossomed; between the third and
fourth, the elevation of the Brazen Serpent; between the fourth and
fifth, the ecstasy of David dancing before the ark &quot;to the sound of a
large lute, a violin, a trombone, but more especially to his own harp.&quot;
After the fifth act the play was concluded with a pageant of religious
chivalry&#8212;the Knights of Malta, S. James, S. Maurice, and the Teutonic
Order&#8212;who had fought for the Cross, and to whom, amid thunderings and
lightnings, as they stood upon the stage, was granted the vision of
&quot;Religion, habited in purest white, full of majesty, with the triple
tiara and the crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">-327-</a></span> keys of S. Peter, holding in her hand a large and
most resplendent cross, adorned with diamonds, rubies and emeralds.&quot; The
resources of a theater which could place so many actors on the stage at
once, and attempt the illusion of clouds and angels, bringing into play
the machinery of transformation scenes, and enriching the whole with a
varied accompaniment of music, must have been considerable. Those who
have spent an hour in the Teatro Farnese at Parma, erected of wood for a
similar occasion, may be able to summon by the aid of the imagination a
shadow of this spectacle before their eyes. That the effect was not
wholly grotesque, though the motives were so hazardous, can be
understood from Milton's description of the descent of Mercy in his
Christmas Ode.<a name="FNanchor_423_424" id="FNanchor_423_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_424" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>For the play of <i>S. Uliva</i>, though first known to us in a Florentine
reprint of 1568, we may assume a more popular origin than that of
Cecchi's Mystery of the Cross. It abounds in rare Renaissance
combinations of pagan with Christian mythology. The action extended over
two days and was interrupted at intervals by dumb shows and lyrical
interludes connected only by a slight thread with the story. At one time
a chase was brought upon the stage. On other occasions pictures,
described with minute attention to details, were presented to the
audience in Tableaux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">-328-</a></span> Vivants. These pictures vividly recall the style
of Florentine masters, Piero di Cosimo or Sandro Botticelli. &quot;In the
interval,&quot; say the stage-directions to the players, &quot;you will cause
three women, well-beseen, to issue, one of them attired in white, one in
red, the other in green, with golden balls in their hands, and with them
a young man robed in white; and let him, after looking many times first
on one and then on another of these damsels, at last stay still and say
the following verses, gazing at her who is clad in green.&quot; This is the
Mask of Hope. In another part the fable of Narcissus has to be
presented, and directions are given for the disappearance of Echo, who
is to repeat the final syllables of the boy's lament. &quot;After he has
uttered all these complaints, let him thrice with a loud voice cry
slowly Ahim&#232;, Ahim&#232;, Ahim&#232;! and let the nymph reply, and having thus
spoken let him stretch himself upon the ground and lie like one dead;
and within a little space let there issue forth four or more nymphs clad
in white, without bows and with dishevelled hair, who, when they have
come where the youth lies dead, shall surround him in a circle and at
last having wrapped him in a white cloth, carry him within, singing this
song<a name="FNanchor_424_425" id="FNanchor_424_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_425" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>:</p>

<p>Night and the God of Sleep again amuse the audience with an allegorical
mask; and the seven deadly sins, figured as men, women and beasts, march
across the stage. At no great distance from a vision of Judgment, the
Sirens are introduced after this fashion: &quot;Now goes the King to Rome;
and you, meanwhile, make four women, naked, or else clothed in
flesh-colored cloth, rise waist-high from the sea, with tresses to the
wind, and let them sing as sweetly as may be the ensuing stanzas twice;
in the which while shall two or three of you come forth, and seem to
fall asleep on earth at the hearing of the song, except one only, who
shall be armed, and with closed ears shall pass the sea unstayed, and
let the said women take those who sleep and cast them in the waves.&quot;
When we reach Uliva's wedding, we meet with the following quaint rubric:
&quot;If you wish to beguile the weariness caused by the length of the show,
and to make the spectators take more delight in this than in any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">-331-</a></span>
interlude, then you must give them some taste of these bridals by
providing a general banquet; but if you mislike the expense, then
entertain the players only.&quot; It would seem that <i>S. Uliva</i> was acted on
the <i>prato</i> of the confraternity, where a booth had been erected.</p>

<p>The forty-three plays comprised in D'Ancona's volumes may be arranged in
three classes&#8212;those which deal with Bible stories or Church doctrine
based on Scripture; dramatized Legends of the saints; and <i>Novelle</i>
transformed into religious fables. Among the first sort may be mentioned
plays of Abraham and Isaac, Joseph, Tobias and Raphael, and Esther; the
Annunciation, the Nativity, S. John in the Desert, Christ preaching in
the Temple, the Conversion of the Magdalen, the Prodigal Son, the
Passion and Resurrection of our Lord, and the Last Judgment. The
<i>Nativit&#224; di Cristo</i> opens with a pastoral reminding us of French
<i>Myst&#232;res</i> and English Miracle-plays.<a name="FNanchor_425_426" id="FNanchor_425_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_426" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> The shepherds are bivouacking
on the hills of Bethlehem when the angel appears to them. For Tudde,
Harvye, Houcken, and Trowle of our Chester play, we find these southern
names, Bobi di Farucchio, Nencio di Pucchio, Randello, Nencietto, and so
forth. But the conduct of the piece is the same. The Italian hinds
discuss their cheese and wine and bread just as the clowns of Cheshire
talk about &quot;ale of Hatton,&quot; &quot;sheep's head sowsed in ale,&quot; and &quot;sour
milk.&quot; Such points of similarity are rare, however; for the
<i>Rappresentazioni</i> were the growth of more refined conditions, and
showed their origin in sentiment and pathos. The anonymous play of <i>Mary
Magdalen</i> rises to a higher level of dra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">-332-</a></span>matic art than any sacred play
in English.<a name="FNanchor_426_427" id="FNanchor_426_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_427" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Her story, as told in these scenes, is the versified
<i>novella</i> of a Vittoria Accoramboni or a Bella Imperia converted by the
preaching of S. Bernardino or Savonarola. It might have happened in Rome
or Florence or Perugia. Magdalen, the lady of noble blood but famous
with ill-fame, fair of person and of heaven-bright countenance, who
dresses splendidly and lives with many lovers, spending her days in the
pleasure of rich banquets and perfumed baths, delighting her heart with
the music of lyres and flutes and the voices of young men, appears
before us with a reality that proves how deep a hold upon the poet's
fancy her picturesque tale had taken. Martha, her good but commonplace
sister, forms a foil to the more impassioned and radiant figure of
Magdalen. She has been cured by Christ, and has heard Him preach. Now
she entreats her sister but to go and listen, for never man spake words
like His. Magdalen scoffs: &quot;Why should I be damned because I do not
follow your strange life? There is time for me to enjoy my youth, and
then to make my peace with God, and Paradise will open wide for me at
last.&quot; Her friend Marcella enters with another argument: &quot;O Magdalen, if
you did but know how fair and gracious are his eyes! Surely he has come
forth straight from heaven; could you but see him once, your heart would
never be divided from him.&quot; This touches the right spring in Magdalen's
mind. She will not go to hear the words of Christ, but the face and form
that came from Paradise allure her. Besides, in the church where Christ
will preach, there will be found new lovers and men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">-333-</a></span> multitudes to
gaze at her. Her maidens array her in gold and crimson, and bind up her
yellow hair; and forth she rides in all her bravery surrounded by her
suitors. What follows may best be told by a translation of the
stage-directions and a passage of the play itself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>And at these last verses Jesus enters the temple; and having
gone up into the pulpit, he begins to preach and to say with a
loud voice, &quot;Homo quidam peregre proficiscens vocavit servos
suos et tradidit illis bona sua.&quot; Now comes Magdalen with her
company, and her young men prepare for her a seat before the
pulpit, and she in all her pomp takes her place upon it,
regarding her own pleasure, nor paying heed as yet to Jesus.
Afterward, Jesus looks at her and goes on preaching, always
keeping his most holy gaze bent upon her; and she, after the
first stanza of the sermon, looks at him, and her eyes meet
those of Jesus. Then he goes on preaching, and says as
follows:</p>

And see how far they should be careless; then<br />
Unto the last he left but one alone:<br />
According to their powers, he charged each one.<br /><br />

To render when his master should arrive;<br />
He who received but twain, did even so,<br />
And added to his sum another two.<br /><br />
But he on whom one talent was bestowed,<br />
Went forthwith and concealed it in the soil:<br />

He who on earth sets his affections still,<br />
Forgetful of the promised heavenly treasure;<br />
He who loves self more than his Maker's will,<br />
And in ill-doing finds continual pleasure;<br />

<p>After the blessing of Jesus, Magdalen, weeping, and with her
head covered, can have no rest for the great confusion that
she felt; and all the people wept, and in great astonishment
were waiting agaze to see what should ensue.</p>
</div>

<p><i>O alma peccatrice, che farai?</i>&#8212;Christ's voice with its recurrences of
gravely sweet persuasion melts Magdalen's heart. She may not speak one
word, until her sister has led her home and comforted her a space. Then
she answers:</p>

<p class="center">Deh, priega Iddio che m'allumini il core!</p>

<p>After this, left alone with her own soul, awakened to the purer
consciousness that Christ has stirred, she takes the box of ointment,
and, despoiled of all her goodly raiment, with her hair disheveled, goes
to the house of the Pharisee. There at last, with the breaking of the
alabaster, she dissolves in tears, and her heart finds peace. In these
scenes, if anywhere, we have the stuff from which the drama might have
been evolved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">-337-</a></span> Magdalen is a living woman, such as Palma might have
painted; and Christ is a real man gifted with power to penetrate the
soul.</p>

<p>The <i>Figliuol Prodigo</i> illustrates the same effort on the poet's part to
steep an old-world story in the vivid colors of to-day.<a name="FNanchor_427_428" id="FNanchor_427_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_428" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> In the
Prodigal himself we find a coarse-hearted villain, like Hogarth's Idle
Apprentice&#8212;vain, silly, lustful, gluttonous, careless of the honor and
love that belong to him in his father's home. The scenes with the
innkeeper, the gamblers, and the ruffians, among whom he runs to ruin,
portray the vulgar dissipations of Florence, and justify the common
identification of taverns with places of ill-fame.<a name="FNanchor_428_429" id="FNanchor_428_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_429" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> There is a touch
of true pathos at the end of the play in the grief of the father who has
lost his son. The conflict of feelings in the heart of the elder
brother, vexed at first with the prodigal's reception, but melting into
love and pity at the fervor of his penitence, is also not without
dramatic spirit. At the very end &quot;a boy with the lyre&quot; enters and
&quot;speaks the moral of the parable.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_429_430" id="FNanchor_429_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_430" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>The movement of these two plays is not impeded by the sanctity of the
subject. When, however, the legend belongs more immediately to the
narrative of Christ's life, the form of the Representation is more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">-338-</a></span>severe. This is especially true of Castellani's <i>Cena e Passione</i>,
where the incidents of the Last Supper, the Agony in the Garden, the
trials before Pilate and Caiaphas, the Flagellation, and the Crucifixion
are narrated with reverential brevity.<a name="FNanchor_430_431" id="FNanchor_430_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_431" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> In reading these scenes, we
must summon to our memory Luca della Robbia's bass-reliefs or the
realistic groups of the Lombard Sacri Monti. The colored terra-cotta
figures in those chapels among the chestnut trees above the Sesia are
but Castellani's poetry conveyed in tableaux, while the Florentine
actors undoubtedly aimed at presenting by their grouping, dresses and
attitudes a living image of such plastic work. But the peculiar pathos
of the Italians found finer expression in picture or fresco&#8212;in Luini's
&quot;Flagellation&quot; at S. Maurizio or the pallid anguish of Tintoretto's
women sunk beneath the Cross in the Scuola di San Rocco&#8212;than in the
fluent stanzas of the sacred playwrights. On the walls of church or
oratory the sweetness and languor of emotion became as dignified in
beauty as the melodies of Pergolese, and its fervor touched at times the
sublimity of tragic passion. Not words but plastic forms were ever the
noblest vehicle of Italian feeling. Yet each kind of art may be
profitably used to illustrate the other, and the simple phrases of the
<i>Rappresentazioni</i> are often the best comments on finished works of
painting. Here, for example, is Raphael's <i>Lo Spasimo</i> in words<a name="FNanchor_431_432" id="FNanchor_431_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_432" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>:</p>

<p>Something artless and caressing in these words <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">-340-</a></span>brings before us Luini's
Joseph with his golden-brown robes and white hair, Mary in her blue and
crimson with the beautiful braided curls of gold. The Magdalen, again,
moves through all these solemn scenes with a grace peculiar to her
story. The poet, like the painter, never forgets that her sins were
forgiven <i>quia multum amavit</i>. She who in Luini's fresco at Lugano
kneels with outstretched arms and long fair rippling loosened hair,
beneath the Cross, is shown in the <i>Resurrezione di Ges&#249; Cristo</i> upon
her knees before the gardener whose one word tells her that she sees her
risen Lord.<a name="FNanchor_434_435" id="FNanchor_434_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_435" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> It is a scene from Fra Angelico, a touch of tenderness
falling like a faint soft light athwart the mass of orthodox tradition.</p>

<p>The sympathy between these shows and the plastic arts may be still
further traced in Belcari's <i>D&#236; del Giudizio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_435_436" id="FNanchor_435_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_436" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> After the usual
prologue an angel thrice blows the trumpet blast that wakes the dead,
crying aloud <i>Surgite!</i> Minos assembles his fiends, and Christ bids the
archangel separate the good from the bad.<a name="FNanchor_436_437" id="FNanchor_436_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_437" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Michael, obedient to this
order, seeks a hypocrite hidden among the just and sets him on the left
hand, while Trajan is taken from the damned and placed among the saved.
Solomon rises alone,<a name="FNanchor_437_438" id="FNanchor_437_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_438" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> and remains undecided in the middle space,
till Michael, charging him with carnal sin, forces him to take his
station <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">-341-</a></span>with the goats. S. Peter now disputes with wicked friars who
think to save themselves by pointing to their cowls and girdles. The
poor appeal to S. Francis, but he answers that poverty is no atonement
for a sinful life. Magdalen refuses help to women who have lived
impenitent. Christ and Mary reply that the hour of grace is past. Then
the representatives of the seven deadly sins step forth and reason with
the virtuous&#8212;the proud man with the humble, the glutton with the
temperate. Sons upbraid their fathers for neglect or evil education.
Others thank God for the discipline that saved them in their youth. At
the last Christ awards judgment, crying to the just: &quot;Ye saw me hungry
and ye fed me, naked and ye clothed me!&quot; and to the unjust: &quot;I was
hungry and ye fed me not, naked and ye clothed me not.&quot; Just and unjust
answer, as in Scripture, with those words whereof the double irony is so
dramatic. The damned are driven off to Hell, and angels open for the
blessed the doors of Paradise.</p>

<p>The <i>Rappresentazioni</i> of the second class offer fewer points of
interest; almost the sole lesson they inculcate being the superiority of
the monastic over the secular life. S. Anthony leaves the world in which
he has lived prosperous and wealthy, incarcerates his sister in a
convent, and becomes a hermit.<a name="FNanchor_438_439" id="FNanchor_438_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_439" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Satan assembles the hosts of hell
and makes fierce war upon his resolution; but the temptation is a poor
affair, and Anthony gets through it by the help of an angel. The play
ends with an assault of the foiled fiend of Avarice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">-342-</a></span> upon three
rogues&#8212;Tagliagambe, Scaramuccia, and Carabello&#8212;who cut each other's
throats over their ill-gotten booty. <i>S. Guglielmo Gualtero</i>, like S.
Francis, sells all that he possesses, embraces poverty, and becomes a
saint.<a name="FNanchor_439_440" id="FNanchor_439_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_440" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>. <i>S. Margaret</i> subdues the dragon, and is beheaded by a
Roman prefect for refusing homage to the pagan deities.<a name="FNanchor_440_441" id="FNanchor_440_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_441" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> <i>SS.
Giovanni e Paolo</i> are Latin confessors of the conventional type.<a name="FNanchor_441_442" id="FNanchor_441_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_442" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
The legends of the <i>Seven Sleepers</i>, <i>S. Ursula</i>, and <i>S. Onofrio</i> are
treated after a like fashion. <i>S. Eufrasia</i> still further illustrates
the medieval ideal of monastic chastity.<a name="FNanchor_442_443" id="FNanchor_442_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_443" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> She leaves her betrothed
husband and her mother to enter a convent. Nothing befalls her, and her
life is good for nothing, except that she exhales the odor of conventual
sanctity and dies. <i>S. Teodora</i> is a variation on the same theme.<a name="FNanchor_443_444" id="FNanchor_443_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_444" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
She refuses Quintiliano, the governor of Asia, in marriage; and is sent
to a bad house, whence Eurialo, a Christian, delivers her. Both are
immediately dispatched to execution. It is probable that the two
last-mentioned plays were intended for representation within the walls
of a nunnery. <i>S. Barbara</i> presents the same motive, with a more marked
theological bias.<a name="FNanchor_444_445" id="FNanchor_444_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_445" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Dioscoro, the father of the saint, hears from his
astrologers that she is fated to set herself against the old gods of his
worship. To avert this calamity, he builds a tower with two windows,
where he shuts her up in the company of orthodox pagan teachers. Barbara
becomes learned in her retirement, and refuses, upon the authority of
Plato, to pay homage to idols. Faith, instead of Love, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">-343-</a></span>finds this new
Dana&#235;, in the person, not of Zeus, but of a priest dispatched by Origen
from Alexandria to convert her to Christianity. The princess learns her
catechism, is baptized, and adds a third window to her tower, in
recognition of the Trinity. It only remains for her father to torture
her cruelly to death.</p>

<p>The outline of these stories is often singularly beautiful, and capable
of poetic treatment. Remembering what Massinger and Decker made of the
<i>Virgin Martyr</i>, we turn with curiosity to <i>S. Teodora</i> or <i>S. Ursula</i>.
Yet we are doomed to disappointment. The ingenuous charm, again, which
painters threw over the puerilities of the monastic fancy, is absent
from these plays. Sodoma's legend of S. Benedict in fresco on the walls
of Monte Oliveto, Carpaccio's romance of S. Ursula painted for her
Scuola at Venice, are touched with the grace of a child's fairy-story.
The <i>Rappresentazioni</i> eliminate all elements of mystery and magic from
the fables, and reduce them to bare prose. The core of the myth or tale
is rarely reached; the depths of character are never penetrated; and
still the wizardry of wonderland is gone. In the hands of these Italian
playwrights the most pregnant story of the Orient or North assumed the
thin slight character of ordinary life. Its richness disappeared. Its
beauty evanesced. Nothing remained but the dry bones of a <i>novella</i>.
Indeed, the prose legends of the fourteenth century are far more
fascinating than these dramatized tales of the Renaissance, which might
be used to prove, if further proof were needed, that the Italian
imagination is not in the highest sense romantic or fantastic, not
far-reaching by symbol or by vision into the depths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">-344-</a></span> nature human and
impersonal. The sense of infinity which gives value to Northern works of
fancy, is unknown in Italy. Sir Thomas Mallory wrote of Arthur's passage
into dreamland<a name="FNanchor_445_446" id="FNanchor_445_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_446" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>: &quot;And when they were at the water's side, even fast
by the banke hoved a little barge with many faire ladies in it, and
among them all was a queene, and all they had blacke hoods, and they
wept and shriked when they saw King Arthur.&quot; The author of the <i>Tavola
Ritonda</i> makes the event quite otherwise precise<a name="FNanchor_446_447" id="FNanchor_446_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_447" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

in quella navicella, e port&#242;llo via in una isoletta di mare; e
quivi mor&#236; di sue ferite, e la fata il sopell&#236; in quella
isoletta.</p>
</div>

<p>This anxiety after verification and distinctness is almost invariable in
Italian literature. The very devil becomes a definite and oftentimes
prosaic personage. External Nature is credited with no inner spirit,
reaching forth from wood or wave or cloud to touch the soul of man in
reverie or trance, or breaking on his charmed senses in the form of
gnome or water-sprite or fairy. Men and women move in clear sunlight,
disenchanted of the gloom or glory, as of star-irradiate vapor, which a
Northern mytho-poet wraps around them, making their humanity thereby
more poignant.</p>

<p>Those who care to connect the genius of a people with the country of
their birth, may find the source of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">-345-</a></span>these mental qualities in the nobly
beautiful, serene and gracious, but never mystical Italian land. The
Latin Cam&#339;n&#230; have neither in ancient nor in modern years evoked the
forms of mythic fable from that landscape. Far less is there the touch
of Celtic or Teutonic inspiration&#8212;the light that never was on sea or
land. The nightingales of Sorrento or Nettuno in no poet's vision have</p>

<p>Down the hillsides between Lucca and Pistoja, where the cypresses stand
in rows and olives cast their shadows on the gray tilled soil, no lover
has dreamed he met Queen Guinevere in spring riding through flowers with
Lancelot. Instead of Morgan le Fay, turning men to lichened and
mist-moistened stones upon the heath, the Italian witch was ever
Locusta, the poison-brewer, or Alcina, the temptress.</p>

<p>This peculiarity of the Italian genius made their architects incapable
of understanding Gothic. This deprived Italian art of that sublimity
which needs a grain of the grotesque for its perfection, a touch of the
uncouth for its accomplishment. The instinct of poets and artists alike
induced them to bring mystery within the sphere of definition, to limit
the marvelous by reducing it to actual conditions, and to impoverish the
terrible by measuring its boundaries. But since every defect has its
corresponding quality, this same instinct secured for the modern age a
world of immaculate loveliness in art and undimmed joyousness in poetry.
If the wonderland of fancy is eliminated, the monstrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">-346-</a></span> and unshaped
have disappeared. With the grotesque vanishes disproportion. Humanity,
conscious of its own emotion, displaces the shadowy people of the
legends. We move in a well-ordered world of cheerfulness and beauty,
made for man, where symmetry of parts is music. Ariosto's jocund irony
is no slight compensation for the imagery of a Northern mythus.</p>

<p>Returning to the <i>Rappresentazioni</i>, we are forced to admit that the
defect of the Italian fancy is more apparent than its quality, in a
species of dramatic art which, being childish, needed some magic spell
to reconcile an adult taste to its puerility.<a name="FNanchor_447_448" id="FNanchor_447_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_448" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> They were written at
the most prosaic moment of the national development, by men who could
not afford to substitute the true Italian poetry of irony and idyllic
sensuousness for the ancient religious spirit. The bondage of the middle
ages was upon them. They were forced to take the extravagance of the
monastic imagination for fact. But they did not really believe; and so
the fact was apprehended frigidly, prosaically. Instead of poetry we get
rhetoric; instead of marvels, gross incredibilities are forced upon us
in the lives of men and women fashioned like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">-347-</a></span> folk who crowd the
streets we know. Another step in the realistic direction would have
transformed all these religious myths into <i>novelle</i>; and then a new
beauty, the beauty of the Decameron and <i>Novellino</i>, would have been
shed upon them. But it was precisely this step that Castellani and
Belcari dared not take, since their purpose remained religious
edification. Nay, their instinct led them in the opposite direction.
Unable to escape the influence of the <i>novella</i>, which was the truest
literary form peculiar to Italy in that age, they converted it into a
sacred legend and treated it with the same rhetorical and insincere
pietism as the stories of the Saints. From S. Barbara to the third-class
<i>Rappresentazioni</i> the transition is easy.</p>

<p>The interest of this group of stories, as illustrating the psychological
conditions of the Italian imagination, is great. Stripped of medieval
mystery, reduced to the proportions of a <i>novella</i>, but not yet invested
with its worldly charm, denuded of the pregnant symbolism or tragic
intensity of their originals, these plays reveal the poverty of the
fifteenth century, the incapacity of the Florentine genius at that
moment to create poetry outside the sphere of figurative art, and in a
region where irony and sensuality and natural passion were alike
excluded. They might be compared to dead bones awaiting the
spirit-breath of mirth and sarcasm to rouse them into life. <i>Teofilo</i> is
the Italian Faustus.<a name="FNanchor_448_449" id="FNanchor_448_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_449" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> A devil accuses him to the Bishop he is
serving. Outcast and dishonored, he seeks Manovello, a Jewish sorcerer,
who takes him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">-348-</a></span> to a cross-way and raises the fiend, Beelzebub. Teofilo
abjures Christ, adores the devil, and signs a promise to be Satan's
bondsman. In return, Beelzebub dispatches a goblin, Farfalletto, to the
Bishop, who believes that an angel has come to bid him restore Teofilo
to honor. Consequently Teofilo regains his post. But in the midst of his
prosperity the renegade is wretched. Stung by conscience, he throws
himself upon the mercy of our Lady. She pleads for him with Christ,
summons the devil, and wrests from his grasp the parchment given by
Teofilo. Poetic justice is satisfied by Manovello's descent to hell.
Such is the prosaic form which the Faust legend assumed in Italy.
Instead of the lust for power and knowledge which consumed the doctor of
Wittenberg, making him exclaim:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
Had I as many souls as there be stars,<br />
I'd give them all for Mephistophilis!
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>we have this commonplace story of a bishop's almoner, driven by a vulgar
trial of his patience to abjure the faith. The intercession of Mary
introduces a farcial element into the piece: the audience is amused by
seeing the devil's contract snatched from him after a jocular
altercation with the Queen of Heaven. Our Mephistophilis is either
fantastically grotesque, as in the old prose-legend, or tragically
saturnine, as in Marlowe's tragedy. The fiend of this Florentine play is
a sort of supernatural usurer, who lends at a short date upon exorbitant
interest, and is nonsuited for fraud in the supreme court of appeal. To
charge the Italian imagination in general with this dwarfing and
defining of a legend that had in it such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">-349-</a></span> elements of grandeur, might be
scarcely fair. The fault lies more perhaps with Florence of the
fifteenth century; yet Florence was the brain of Italy, and if the
people there could find no more of salt or savor in a myth like that of
Theophilus, this fact gives food for deep reflection to the student of
their culture.</p>

<p>In the <i>R&#232; Superbo</i> we have one of those stories which traveled from the
far East in the middle ages over the whole of Europe, acquiring a
somewhat different form in every country.<a name="FNanchor_449_450" id="FNanchor_449_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_450" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> The proud king in the
midst of his prosperity falls sick. He takes a short day's journey to a
watering-place, and bathes. By night an angel assumes his shape, dons
his royal robes, summons his folk, and fares homeward to his palace. The
king, meanwhile, is treated by the innkeeper as an impudent rascal. He
begs some rags to cover his nakedness, and arrives in due time at the
city he had left the day before. There his servants think him mad; but
he obtains an audience with the angel, who reads him a sermon on
humility, and then restores him to his throne. In this tale there lay
nothing beyond the scope of the Italian imagination. Consequently the
treatment is adequate, and the situations copied from real life are
really amusing. The play of <i>Barlaam e Josafat</i> by Bernardo Pulci is
more ambitious.<a name="FNanchor_450_451" id="FNanchor_450_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_451" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Josafat's father hears from his astrologers that
the child will turn Christian. Accordingly he builds a tower, and places
his son there, surrounded with all things pleasant to the senses and
cheering to the heart of man. His servants receive strict orders that
the boy should never leave his prison, lest haply, meeting with old <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">-350-</a></span>age
or poverty or sickness, he should think of Christ. On one occasion they
neglect this rule. Josafat rides forth and sees a leper and a blind man,
and learns that age and death and pain are in store for all. This stirs
reflection, and prepares him to receive the message of one Barlaam, who
comes disguised as a merchant to the tower. Barlaam offers him a jewel
which restores sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, speech to the
dumb, and which turns a fool to wisdom. The jewel is the faith of
Christ. Josafat is instantly converted and baptized; nor can the
persuasions of wise men or the allurements of women overcome his fixed
resolve. So firmly rooted is his new faith, so wonderful his eloquence,
that he converts his father and the Court, and receives for his great
wisdom the crown of his ancestors. Yet an earthly throne savors too much
in his eyes of worldly pride. Therefore he renounces it, and lives
thenceforth a holy hermit. This legend, it will be perceived, is a dim
echo of the wonderful history of Sidd&#226;rtha, the founder of Buddhism.
Beautiful as are the outlines, too beautiful to be spoiled by any
telling, Pulci has done his best to draw it from the dream-world of
romance into the sphere of prose. At the same time, while depriving it
of romance, he has not succeeded in dramatizing it. We do not feel the
psychological necessity for the changes in any of the characters; the
charm of each strange revolution is destroyed by the clumsy preparation
of the motives. We are forced to feel that the playwright was working on
the lines of a legend he did not understand and could not vitalize. The
wonder is that he thought of choosing it and found it ready to his hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">-351-</a></span></p>

<p>Few of the <i>Rappresentazioni</i> are so interesting as <i>S. Uliva</i>.<a name="FNanchor_451_452" id="FNanchor_451_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_452" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
Uliva is no saint of the Catholic calendar but a daughter of world-old
romance. Her legend may be read in the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>, in Philip de
Beaumanoir's <i>Roman de la Mannelline</i>, in Ser Giovanni's <i>Pecorone</i>, in
Chaucer's <i>Man of Law's Tale</i>, in Grimm's <i>Handless Maiden</i>, and in
Russian and Servian variations on the same theme. It is in truth the
relic of some very ancient myth, used by the poets of all ages for the
sake of its lesson of patience in affliction, its pathos of persecuted
innocence. The form the tale assumed in Italy is this. Uliva, daughter
of the Roman Emperor, Giuliano, is begged in marriage by her own father,
who says she has more beautiful hands than any other princess. She cuts
her hands off, and Giuliano sends her to Britain to be killed. But her
murderers take pity on her, and leave her in a wood alone. There the
King of Britain finds her and places her under the protection of his
queen. After many misfortunes the Virgin Mary restores her hands, and
she is married to the King of Castile. She bears him a son; but by this
time she has roused the jealousy and hatred of the queen-mother, who
takes the opportunity of the king's absence to poison his mind against
her by letters, and shortly after drives her forth with her child. Uliva
reaches Rome, and lives there twelve years unknown, till her husband,
who has discovered and punished his mother's treason, and has sought his
wronged wife sorrowing, at last rejoins her and recognizes in her son
his heir. The play ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">-352-</a></span> with a reconciliation scene between the
Emperor, the King, and Uliva, the Pope pronouncing benedictions on the
whole party. It will be seen from this brief abstract of the legend that
the <i>Rappresentazione</i> is a chivalrous <i>novella</i> dramatized. Several old
pathetic stories have been woven into one, and the heroine has been
dignified with the title of saint because of the pity she inspires.
Uliva belongs to the sisterhood of Boccaccio's Griselda, Ariosto's
Ginevra, and the Queen in our old ballad of Sir Aldingar. The medieval
imagination, after creating types of stateliness like Guinivere, of
malice like Morgana, of love like Iseult, turned aside and dwelt upon
the tender delicacy of a woman, whose whole strength is her beauty,
gentleness, and patience; who suffers all things in the spirit of
charity; whom the angels love and whom our Lady cherishes; who wins all
hearts of men by her goodliness; and who, like Una, passes unscathed
through peril and persecution until at last her joy is perfected by the
fruition of her lawful love. It was precisely this element of romance
that touched the Italian fancy; and the playwright of <i>S. Uliva</i> has
shown considerable skill in his treatment of it. Piteous details are
accumulated with remorseless pertinacity upon the head of the
unfortunate Uliva, in order to increase the pathos of her situation.
There is no mitigation of her hardships except in her own innocence, and
in the loving compassion wrung by her beauty from her rude tormentors.
This want of relief, together with the brusque passage from one incident
to another, betrays a lack of dramatic art. But the poet, whoever he
was, succeeded in sustaining the ideal of purity and beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">-353-</a></span> he
conceived. He shows how all Uliva's sufferings as well as her good
fortune were due to the passions her beauty inspired, and how it was her
purity that held her harmless to the end.</p>

<p><i>Stella</i> is the same story slightly altered, with a somewhat different
cast of characters and an evil-hearted step-mother in the place of the
malignant queen.<a name="FNanchor_452_453" id="FNanchor_452_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_453" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> If we compare both fables with Grimm's version of
the &quot;Handless Maiden,&quot; the superiority of the Northern conception cannot
fail to strike us. The Italian <i>novella</i>, though written for the people,
exhibits the external pomp and grandeur of royalty. All its motives are
drawn from the clash of human passions. Yet these are hidden beneath a
superincumbent mass of trivialities. The German tale has a background of
spiritual mystery&#8212;good and evil powers striving for the possession of a
blameless soul. When the husband, who has been deceived by feminine
malice, takes his long journey without food as a penitent to find his
injured wife, how far deeper is the pathos and the poetry of the
situation than the Italian apparatus of couriers with letter-bags,
chancellors, tournaments, and royal progresses undertaken with a vast
parade, can compass! The Northern fancy, stimulated by the simple beauty
of the situation, confines itself to the passionate experience of the
heart and soul. The Florentine playwright adheres to the material facts
of life, and takes a childish pleasure in passing the splendors of kings
and princes in review. By this method he vulgarizes the legend he
handles. Beneath his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">-354-</a></span> touch it ceases to be holy ground. The enchantment
of the myth has evanesced.</p>

<p><i>Rosana</i> is simply the story of <i>Floire et Blanchefleur</i>, which
Boccaccio had already worked into his <i>Filocopo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_453_454" id="FNanchor_453_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_454" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> Austero, King of
Rome, goes with his wife on pilgrimage to Holy Land. He falls into the
hands of the King of Cesaria, and is slain with all his folk, except the
queen. She is taken captive to Cesaria, where she gives birth to Rosana
on the same day that Ulimeno is born to her master. When Ulimeno grows
up, he loves the daughter of his father's slave. His parents seek to
cure this passion by sending him to France, and at the same time sell
Rosana to some merchants, who convey her to the Sultan's harem. Ulimeno
returns to Cesaria in deep distress, and vows that he will never rest
till he has regained his love. After a proper number of adventures, he
finds Rosana in the seraglio, where notwithstanding the Sultan's
admiration of her beauty, she has preserved her virginity. They are
married, and Ulimeno is converted, with his realm, to Christianity. The
prettiest parts of this play are the scenes in the seraglio, where
Rosana refuses comfort from the Sultan's women, and the contrivances
devised by Ulimeno to get speech with her. Except that Rosana and her
parents are Christian and that the saints protect her, there is nothing
to justify the title of <i>Sacra Rappresentazione</i>. It is a love-romance,
like Shakspere's <i>Pericles</i>.</p>

<p>Another <i>novella</i> of less poetic interest is dramatized in <i>Agnolo
Ebreo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_454_455" id="FNanchor_454_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_455" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Agnolo, the Jew, has a Christian wife, who persuades him
instead of putting out his money at usury to lend it to Christ by giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">-355-</a></span>it away in alms. Having thus cast his bread upon the waters, he
recovers it again after not many days by picking up money in the streets
and finding a jewel in a fish's belly. He is baptized, because he sees
clearly that the God of the Christians can make him rich. Only its
tedious solemnity prevents this play from being a farce.</p>

<p>Three <i>Rappresentazioni</i> are written upon incidents of pilgrimage to the
shrine of S. James of Compostella&#8212;Il Santo Barone, as he is always
called. The first of these is entitled <i>Rappresentazione di un
Pellegrino</i>.<a name="FNanchor_455_456" id="FNanchor_455_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_456" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> It tells the tale of a certain Guglielmo who vowed the
journey to Compostella on his sick bed. Upon the road he meets with a
fiend in the disguise of S. James, who persuades him to commit suicide.
No sooner is he dead, than the devil grasps his soul, as may be seen in
Lorenzetti's fresco of the Campo Santo, and makes away with it toward
hell. S. James stops him, and a voluble altercation takes place between
them, at the end of which the soul, who keeps crying <i>misericordia</i> at
intervals, is rescued and restored to its body. Then Guglielmo completes
his vow, and returns joyfully to his wife. <i>I due Pellegrini</i> is more
complex.<a name="FNanchor_456_457" id="FNanchor_456_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_457" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Arrigo Coletta leaves his wife and son at Rome;
Constantino Constante leaves his wife and three sons at Genoa; and both
set forth to Compostella. On the way they meet and make friends; but the
Genoese dies before they have got far upon their journey. His Roman
friend carries the dead body to Compostella, where S. James restores it
to life, and both return in safety to their homes. After sojourning some
time in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">-356-</a></span>Rome, Arrigo falls sick of leprosy, and has to go forth and
wander up and down the earth. Chance brings him to the house of the
Genoese who had received such benefits from him upon their pilgrimage.
They consult doctors and wise men together, who assure them that no cure
can be wrought unless the leper bathe from head to foot in the blood of
virgins. This determines Constantino to sacrifice all that he holds
dearest in the world. He kills his three sons, and prepares a bath of
their blood, which restores his old benefactor to health. But the Saint
of Compostella has still his eye upon his servants. A miracle brings the
three boys back to life. They are found with golden apples in their
hands, and the play ends with a general thanksgiving. The prosy
bluntness with which the incidents of this strange story are treated as
matter of fact, is scarcely less remarkable than the immorality which
substitutes mere thaumaturgy for the finer instincts of humanity. The
exaggerated generosity of Constantino might be paralleled from hundreds
of <i>novelle</i>. This one virtue seems to have had extraordinary
fascination for the Italians. <i>I tre Pellegrini</i> is based upon a legend
of medieval celebrity, versified by Southey in his &quot;Pilgrimage to
Compostella.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_457_458" id="FNanchor_457_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_458" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> A father, a mother, and a son of great personal
beauty set forth together for the shrine of S. Iago. On the road they
put up at an inn, where Falconetta, the host's daughter, falls in love
with the boy and tempts him. Thwarted in her will, she vows to ruin him;
and for this purpose, puts a silver cup into his traveling bag. In the
morning the pilgrims are overtaken by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">-357-</a></span> police, who find the cup and
hang the beautiful young man. The parents complete their vow, and on the
way back discover their son upon the gallows alive and well. Falconetta
is burned, and her parents are hanged&#8212;the old host remarking, not
without humor, that, though he was innocent of this crime, he had
murdered enough people in his day to have deserved his fate. The style
of this play merits more praise than can be bestowed on the
<i>Rappresentazioni</i> in general. Falconetta is a real theatrical
character, and the bustle of the inn on the arrival of the guests is
executed with dramatic vigor.</p>

<p>In their <i>Sacre Rappresentazioni</i> the Florentines advanced to the very
verge of the true drama. After adapting the Miracle-plays of medieval
orthodoxy to their stage, they versified the Legends of the Saints, and
went so far as to dramatize novels of a purely secular character. The
<i>Figliuol Prodigo</i> and the farce appended to the <i>Pellegrino</i> contain
the germs of vernacular comedy. S. Maddalena is a complete character. S.
Uliva is delicately sketched and well sustained. The situation at the
opening of the <i>Tre Pellegrini</i> is worked out with real artistic skill.
Lastly, in the <i>Esaltazione della Croce</i> a regular five-act tragedy was
attempted.</p>

<p>From the oratories of the Compagnie and the parlors of the convents this
peculiar form of art was extended to the Courts and public theaters.
Poliziano composed a <i>Rappresentazione</i> on the classical fable of
Orpheus, and Niccol&#242; da Correggio another on the myth of Cephalus and
Procris.<a name="FNanchor_458_459" id="FNanchor_458_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_459" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Other attempts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">-358-</a></span> secularize the religious drama
followed, until, in 1521, Francesco Mantovano put the contemporary
history of the French General Lautrec upon the boards.</p>

<p>Still the fact remains that the <i>Sacre Rappresentazioni</i> did not lead to
the production of a national Italian theater. If we turn to the history
of our Elizabethan stage, we shall find that, after the age of the
Miracles and Moralities had passed, a new and independent work of art,
emanating from the creative genius of Marlowe and Shakspere, put England
in the possession of that great rarity, a Drama commensurate with the
whole life of the nation at one of its most brilliant epochs. To this
accomplishment of the dramatic art the Italians never attained. The
causes of their failure will form the subject of a separate inquiry when
we come to consider the new direction taken by the playwrights at the
Courts of Ferrara and Rome.</p>

<p>As an apology for the space here devoted to the analysis of plays
childish in their subject-matter, prosaic in their treatment, and
fruitless of results, it may be urged that in the <i>Sacre
Rappresentazioni</i> better than elsewhere we can study the limitations of
the popular Italian genius at the moment when the junction was effected
between humanism and the spirit of the people.</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">In</span> dealing with the mass of Italian literature between the dates 1470
and 1530, several methods suggest themselves, each of which offers
certain advantages, while none is wholly satisfactory. In the <i>first</i>
place we might adopt a chronological division, and arrange the chief
authors of whom we have to treat, by periods. Lorenzo de' Medici,
Poliziano, Luigi, Pulci, Boiardo, and Sannazzaro would be the leading
names in the first group. In the second we should place Ariosto,
Machiavelli, Guicciardini and the minor historians of Florence. Bembo
would lead a third class, including Castiglione, La Casa, and the
Petrarchistic poets of the Academies. A fourth would be headed by
Pietro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">-360-</a></span> Aretino, and would embrace the burlesque writers and minor
critical prosaists of the decadence. The advantage of this method is
that it corresponds to a certain regular progression in the evolution of
Italian genius during that brief space of brilliant activity. Yet the
chronological stages are not sufficiently well marked to justify its
exclusive adoption. The first group is separated from the rest by a real
interval, since the men who compose it died, with one exception, before
the close of the fifteenth century, about the year of Charles VIII.'s
entrance into Italy.<a name="FNanchor_459_460" id="FNanchor_459_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_460" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> But the authors of the second, third, and
fourth groups lived almost contemporaneously, covering the whole period
of Italy's greatest literary glory and deepest national discomfiture,
and witnessing the final extinction of her liberty in the settlement
effected by the policy of Charles V.<a name="FNanchor_460_461" id="FNanchor_460_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_461" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Nor, again, can we trace in
the several phases of literature they represent, so clear a process of
expansion as may be detected in the successive stages of artistic or
humanistic development. When the work effected by the first group was
accomplished, both the language and the literature of Italy became in a
true sense national, and the cultivated classes of all districts,
trained in the common discipline of humanistic studies, set themselves
with one accord and simultaneously to the task of polishing the mother
tongue. This fact in the history of Italian literature <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">-361-</a></span>suggests a
<i>second</i> method of classification. We might take the three chief centers
of renascence at the close of the fifteenth century&#8212;Florence, Ferrara,
Naples&#8212;and show how the local characteristics of these cities affected
their great writers. Rome during the pontificate of Leo X.; Urbino under
the rule of Guidubaldo Montefeltre; Milan in the days of the last
Sforzas; Venice at the epoch of Aldo's settlement; might next be chosen
to illustrate the subsequent growth of Italian culture, when it ceased
to be Tuscan, Neapolitan, and Ferrarese. Yet though this local method of
arrangement offers many advantages, and has the grand merit of fixing
the attention upon one important feature of intellectual life in
Italy&#8212;its many-sidedness and diversity, due to the specific qualities
of cities vying with each other in a common exercise of energy&#8212;still it
would not do for the historian of Italian culture at one of its most
brilliant moments to accentuate minor differences, when it ought to be
his object to portray the genius of the people as a whole. In a word,
this classification has the same defect as the treatment of the arts by
Schools.<a name="FNanchor_461_462" id="FNanchor_461_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_462" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Moreover, it cannot fail to lead to repetition and
confusion; for though the work we have to analyze was carried on in
several provinces, yet each Court and each city produced material of the
same general character. Novels, for example, were written at Florence as
well as Milan. Rome saw the first representation of comedies no less
than Ferrara. The romantic epic was not confined to the Court of the
Estensi, nor dissertations on the gentle life to that of Urbino. We are
led by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">-362-</a></span> foregoing considerations to yet a <i>third</i> method of
arrangement. Would it not be scientific to divide the literature of the
Renaissance into its chief branches, and to treat of the romantic epic,
the <i>novella</i>, the stage, the idyll, lyric verse, essays in prose,
histories, and so forth, under separate chapters? Undoubtedly there is
much to say for such a treatment of the subject. Yet when we consider
that it necessitates our bringing the same authors under review in
several successive sections, confuses chronology, and effaces local
distinctions, it will be seen that to follow this system exclusively
would be unwise. It is too strictly analytical for our purpose. That
purpose is to draw a portrait of the Italian spirit as expressed in the
vernacular literature of about seventy years of exceptional splendor;
and perhaps it will be conceded by the student that instinct, conscious
of the end in view, conscious also of these several methods, but
unwilling to be hampered by any one of them too rigorously followed out,
will be a safer guide than formal accuracy.</p>

<p>I therefore propose in the remaining chapters of this book to adopt a
mixed method, partaking of the chronological in so far as I shall
attempt to show a certain process of evolution from the renascence led
by Lorenzo de' Medici to the decadence typified in Pietro Aretino,
insisting upon local peculiarities where it can be clearly proved that
these contributed an important element to the total result, and relying
on the classification by subjects for bringing scattered details under
general consideration. Five men of the highest eminence mark stages in
the history we have to review. These are Poliziano, Ariosto and
Machi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">-363-</a></span>avelli, Bembo and Pietro Aretino. Chronologically, they represent
four moments of development&#8212;the initial, the consummate, the
academical, and the decadent. But if we discard chronology and regard
their intellectual qualities alone, we might reduce them to three.
Merging Poliziano and Bembo in Ariosto, retaining Machiavelli and Pietro
Aretino, we obtain the three prominent phases of Renaissance culture in
Italy&#8212;firstly, serene, self-satisfied, triumphant art, glorying in the
beauty of form for form's sake, and aiming at perfection in style of
sunny and delightful loveliness; secondly, profound scientific analysis,
taking society for its object, dissecting human history and institutions
without prejudice or prepossession, unqualified by religious or ethical
principles, pushing its logical method to the utmost verge of audacity,
and startling the world with terror by the results of its materialistic
philosophy; thirdly, moral corruption unabashed and unrestrained,
destitute of shame because devoid of conscience, boldly asserting itself
and claiming the right to rule society with cynical effrontery. Round
Ariosto are grouped the romantic and idyllic poets, the novelists and
comic playwrights, all the tribe of joyous merry-makers, who translated
into prose and verse the beauty found in painting of the golden age.
With Machiavelli march the historians and political philosophers, the
school of Pomponazzi and the materialistic analysts, who led the way for
a new birth of science in the Baconian speculations of the Cosentine
academy. Aretino is the coryph&#230;us of a multitude of scribes and
courtiers, literary gladiators, burlesque authors of obscene <i>Capitoli</i>,
men of evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">-364-</a></span> character, who used the pen for poniard, and were the fit
successors of invective-writers.</p>

<p>If we turn from men to cities, and seek to define the parts played by
the several communities in this work of creating an Italian literature,
we shall find that Florence fixes the standard of language, and
dominates the nation by the fame of her three poets of the fourteenth
century. Florence, moreover, gives birth to Machiavelli, Guicciardini,
and the political theorists who form a group around them. Florentine wit
and humor lend a certain pungency to all the products of the golden age.
Naples adds the luxury of southern color, felt in Sannazzaro's waxen
paragraphs and Pontano's voluptuous hendecasyllables. Ferrara develops
the chivalrous elements of the romantic epic, shelters Ariosto, and
produces the pastoral drama, that eminently characteristic product of
the late Renaissance. Milan is the home of Bandello, who takes the first
rank among the novelists and leads a school of Lombard writers in that
style. Rome does little for the general culture of the nation, except
that in the age of Leo the Papal Court formed a center for studious men
of all classes and qualities. Her place in literature is therefore
analogous to that she occupies in art and scholarship.<a name="FNanchor_462_463" id="FNanchor_462_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_463" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Aretino
chooses the city of the lagoons for his retreat, not without a certain
propriety; for Venice had become the Paris of the sixteenth century, and
here the press was more active than elsewhere in Italy. His instinct led
the master of lampoon, the prince of pamphleteers, to the city which
combined the utmost license of printing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">-365-</a></span> the most highly developed
immorality of manners. Thus, seen from many points of view and
approached with different objects of study, men, places, and matter
alike furnish their own pivots for treatment. Italy, unlike England and
France, has no political and intellectual metropolis, no London and no
Paris, where the historian may take his stand securely to survey the
manifold activities of the race as from a natural center. He must be
content to shift his ground and vary his analytic method, keeping
steadily in mind those factors which by their interaction and
combination determine the phenomena he has in view.</p>

<p>We are now at length upon the threshold of the true Renaissance. The
division between popular literature and humanistic culture is about to
end. Classic form, appropriated by the scholars, will be given to the
prose and poetry of the Italian language. The fusion, divined and
attempted, rather than accomplished by Alberti, will be achieved. Men as
great as Machiavelli and Ariosto henceforth need not preface their <i>cose
volgari</i> with apologies. The new literature is no longer Tuscan, but
Italian&#8212;national in the widest and deepest sense of the word, when
Venetian Bembo, Neapolitan Sannazzaro, Ariosto from Reggio, Boiardo
Count of Scandiano, Castiglione the Mantuan and Tasso the Bergamasque
vie with Tuscan Pulci and Poliziano, Machiavelli and Guicciardini, in
the creation of the golden age.</p>

<p>The renascence of Italian took place almost simultaneously in three
centers: at Florence under the protection of the Medici, at Ferrara in
the castle of the Estensi, and at Naples in the Aragonese Court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">-366-</a></span> Rome
from the pontificate of Innocent VIII. to that of Leo X. was almost dumb
and deaf to literature. Venice waited till the period of the press.
Milan produced nothing. It was but gradually that the wave of national
culture reached the minor states. The three cities to which Italy owed
the resurrection of her genius were ruled by princes, and the new
literature felt the influence of Courts from the commencement. Indeed,
the whole conditions of Italy had been altered since the death of
Boccaccio in 1375. The middle ages had been swept away. Of their modes
of thought, religious beliefs, political ideals, scholastic theories,
scarcely a vestige remained. Among the cities which had won or kept
their independence during the fourteenth century, only one remained free
from a master's yoke; and even Venice, though she showed no outward
signs of decadence, had reached the utmost verge of her development. The
citizens who had fought the battles of the Communes round their banners
and their sacred cars, were now quiet burghers, paying captains of
adventure to wage mimic warfare with political or commercial rivals in
neighboring States. A class of professional diplomatists corresponding
to these mercenary war-contractors had arisen, selected from the ranks
of the scholars for their rhetorical gifts and command of Latin style.
The humanists themselves constituted a new and powerful body, a nation
within the nation, separated from its higher social and political
interests, selfish, restless, greedy for celebrity, nomadic, disengaged
from local ties, conscious of their strength, and swaying with the vast
prestige of learning in that age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">-367-</a></span> the intellectual destinies of the
race. Insolent and ambitious in all that concerned their literary
pretensions, these men were servile in their private life. They gained
their daily bread by flatteries and menaces, hanging about the Courts of
petty despots, whose liberality they paid with adulation or quickened
with the threat of infamy in libels. At the same time the humanists,
steeped in the best and worst that could be extracted from the classics,
confounding the dross of Greek and Roman literature with its precious
metal in their indiscriminate worship of antiquity, and debarred through
want of criticism from assimilating the noblest spirit of the pagan
culture, had created a new mental atmosphere. The work they accomplished
for Italy, though mixed in quality, had two undeniable merits. Not only
had they restored the heritage of the past and broken down the barrier
between the ancient and the modern world, bringing back the human
consciousness from the torpor of the middle ages to a keen and vivid
sense of its own unity; but they so penetrated and imbued each portion
of the Italian nation with their enthusiasm, that, intellectually at
least, the nation was now one and ready for a simultaneous progress on
the path of culture.<a name="FNanchor_463_464" id="FNanchor_463_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_464" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>It so happened that at this very moment, when the unity of Italy in art
and scholarship had been achieved, external quiet succeeded to the
discords of three centuries. The ancient party-cries of Emperor and
Church, of Guelf and Ghibelline, of noble and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">-368-</a></span> burgher, of German and
Latin ingredients within the body politic had gradually ceased and been
forgotten. The Italic element, deriving its instincts from Roman
civilization, triumphed over the alien and the feudal; and though this
victory was attended with the decay of the Communes that had striven to
achieve it, yet the final outcome was a certain homogeneity of
conditions in all the great centers of national life. Italy became a
net-work of cultivated democracies, ruled by tyrants of different
degrees. The middle of the fifteenth century witnessed the commencement
of that halcyon period of forty years' tranquillity, destined to be
broken by the descent of Charles VIII., in 1494, upon which Machiavelli
and Guicciardini from amid the tempests of the next half century looked
back with eyes of wonder and of envy. Constantinople fell, and the
undoubted primacy of the civilized races came to the Italians. Lorenzo
de' Medici was regarded as the man who, by his political ability and
firm grasp of the requisite conditions for maintaining peace in the
peninsula, had established and secured the equilibrium between mutually
jealous and antagonistic States. Whether the merit of that repose, so
fruitful of results in art and literature for the Italians, was really
due to Lorenzo's sagacity, or whether the shifting forces of the nation
had become stationary for a season by the operation of circumstances,
may fairly be questioned. Yet there is no doubt that the unprecedented
prosperity of the people coincided with his administration of Florence,
and ended when he ceased to guide the commonwealth. It was at any rate a
singular good fortune that connected the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">-369-</a></span> of this extraordinary man
with the high-tide of material prosperity in Italy and with the
resurrection of her national literature.</p>

<p>The figure of Lorenzo de' Medici has more than once already crossed the
stage of this history.<a name="FNanchor_464_465" id="FNanchor_464_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_465" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Whether dealing with the political
conditions, or the scholarship, or the fine arts of the Renaissance, it
is impossible to omit his name. There is therefore now no need to sketch
his character or to inquire into the incidents of his Florentine
administration. It will suffice to remind the readers of this book that
he finally succeeded in so clinching the power of the Casa Medici that
no subsequent revolutions were able to destroy it. The part he played as
a patron of artists and scholars, and as a writer of Italian, was
subordinate to his political activity in circumstances of peculiar
difficulty. While controlling the turbulent democracy of Florence and
gaining recognition for his tyranny from jealous princes, he still
contrived to lead his age in every branch of culture, deserving the
magnificent eulogium of Poliziano, who sang of him in the
<i>Nutricia</i><a name="FNanchor_465_466" id="FNanchor_465_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_466" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>:</p>

<p>Lorenzo de' Medici was the last apologist for the mother speech, as he
was the first and chief inaugurator of the age when such apologies were
no longer to be needed. He took a line somewhat different from Alberti's
in his defense of Italian, proving not merely its utility but boldly
declaring its equality with the classic languages. We possess a short
essay of his, written with this purpose, where he bestows due praise on
Dante, Boccaccio and Guido Cavalcanti, and affirms in the teeth of the
humanists that Petrarch wrote better love-poems than Ovid, Tibullus,
Catullus or Propertius.<a name="FNanchor_466_467" id="FNanchor_466_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_467" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> Again, in his epistle to Federigo of
Aragon, sent with a MS. volume containing a collection of early Tuscan
poetry, he passes acute and sympathetic judgments on the lyrists from
Guittone of Arezzo to Cino da Pistoja, proving that he had studied their
works to good purpose and had formed a correct opinion of the origins of
Italian literature.<a name="FNanchor_467_468" id="FNanchor_467_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_468" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Lorenzo does not write like a man ashamed of
the vernacular or forced to use it because he can command no better. He
is sure of the justice of his cause, and determined by precept and
example and by the prestige of his princely rank to bring the literature
he loves into repute again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">-371-</a></span></p>

<p>No one could have been better fitted for the task. Unlike Alberti,
Lorenzo was a Florentine of the Florentines, Tuscan to the backbone,
imbued with the spirit of his city, a passionate lover of her customs
and pastimes, a complete master of her vernacular. His education, though
it fitted him for Platonic discussions with Ficino and rendered him an
amateur of humanistic culture, had failed to make a pedant of him. Much
as he appreciated the classics, he preferred his Tuscan poets; and what
he learned at school, he brought to bear upon the study of the native
literature. Consequently his style is always idiomatic; whether he seeks
the elevation of grave diction or reproduces the talk of the streets, he
uses language like a man who has habitually spoken the words which he
commits to paper. His brain was vigorous, and his critical faculty
acute. He lived, moreover, in close sympathy with his age, never rising
above it, but accurately representing its main tendencies. At the same
time he was sufficiently a poet to delight a generation that had seen no
great writer of verse since Boccaccio. Though his work is in no sense
absolutely first rate, he wrote nothing that a man of ability might not
have been pleased to own.</p>

<p>Lorenzo's first essays in poetry were sonnets and <i>canzoni</i> in the style
of the <i>trecento</i>. It is a mistake to classify him, as some historians
of literature have done, with the deliberate imitators of Petrarch, or
to judge his work by its deflection from the Petrarchistic standard of
pure style. His youthful lyrics show the appreciative study of Dante and
Guido Cavalcanti no less than of the poet of Vaucluse; and though they
affect the conventional melancholy of the Petrarchistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">-372-</a></span> mannerism, they
owe their force to the strong objective spirit of the fifteenth century.
Lorenzo's originality consists in the fusion he effected between the
form of the love-lyric handed down from Petrarch and the realistic
genius of the age of Ghirlandajo. This is especially noticeable in the
sonnets that describe the beauties of the country. They are not
penetrated with emotion permeating and blurring the impressions made by
natural objects on the poet's mind. His landscapes are not hazy with the
atmosphere, now luminous, now somber, of a lover's varying mood. On the
contrary, every object is defined and classified; and the lady sits like
a beautiful figure in a garden, painted with no less loving care in all
its details than herself.<a name="FNanchor_468_469" id="FNanchor_468_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_469" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> These pictures, very delicate in their
minute and truthful touches, affect our fancy like a panel of Benozzo
Gozzoli, who omits no circumstance of the scene he undertakes to
reproduce, crowds it with incidents and bestows the same attention upon
the principal subjects and the accessories. The central emotion of
Lorenzo's verse is scarcely love, but delight in the country&#8212;the
Florentine's enjoyment of the villa, with its woods and rivulets, the
pines upon the hillsides, the song-birds, and the pleasures of the
chase.</p>

<p>The following sonnet might be chosen as a fair specimen of the new
manner introduced into literature by Lorenzo. Its classical coloring,
deeply felt and yet somewhat frigid, has the true stamp of the
<i>quattrocento</i><a name="FNanchor_469_470" id="FNanchor_469_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_470" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>:</p>

<p>That Lorenzo was incapable of loving as Dante or Petrarch or even
Boccaccio loved, is obvious in every verse he wrote. The spirit in him
neither triumphs over the flesh nor struggles with it, nor yet submits a
willing and intoxicated victim. It remains apart and cold, playing with
fancies, curiously surveying the carnival of lusts that hold their revel
in the breast whereof it is the lord. Under these conditions he could
take the wife his mother found for him at Rome, and record the fact in
his diary<a name="FNanchor_470_471" id="FNanchor_470_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_471" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>; he could while away his leisure with venal beauties or
country girls at his villas; but of love in the poet's sense he had no
knowledge. It is true that, nurtured as he was in the traditions of
fourteenth-century verse, he thought it necessary to establish a titular
mistress of his heart. The account he gives of this proceeding in a
commentary on his own sonnets, composed after the model of the <i>Vita
Nuova</i>, is one of his best pieces of writing. He describes the day when
the beautiful Simonetta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">-374-</a></span> Cattaneo, his brother Giuliano's lady, was
carried to her grave with face uncovered, lying beneath the sunlight on
her open bier. All Florence was touched to tears by the sight, and the
poets poured forth elegies. The month was April, and the young earth
seemed to have put on her robe of flowers only to make the pathos of
that death more poignant. Then, says Lorenzo: &quot;Night came; and I with a
friend most dear to me went communing about the loss we all had
suffered. While we spoke, the air being exceedingly serene, we turned
our eyes to a star of surpassing brightness, which toward the west shone
forth with such luster as not only to conquer all the other stars, but
even to cast a shadow from the objects that intercepted its light. We
marveled at it a while; and then, turning to my friend, I said: 'There
is no need for wonder, since the soul of that most gentle lady has
either been transformed into yon new star or has joined herself to it.
And if this be so, that splendor of the star is nowise to be wondered
at; and even as her beauty in life was of great solace to our eyes, so
now let us comfort ourselves at the present moment with the sight of so
much brilliance. And if our eyes be weak and frail to bear such
brightness, pray we to the god, that is to her deity, to give them
virtue, in order that without injury unto our sight we may awhile
contemplate it.' ... Then, forasmuch as it appeared to me that this
colloquy furnished good material for a sonnet, I left my friend and
composed the following verses, in which I speak about the star
aforesaid:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
&quot;O lucid star, that with transcendent light<br />
<span class="ind1">Quenchest of all those neighboring stars the gleam,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">-375-</a></span><br />
<span class="ind1">Why thus beyond thine usage dost thou stream,</span><br />
<span class="ind1">Why art thou fain with Ph&#339;bus still to fight?</span><br />
Haply those beauteous eyes, which from our sight<br />
<span class="ind1">Death stole, who now doth vaunt himself supreme,</span><br />
<span class="ind1">Thou hast assumed: clad with their glorious beam,</span><br />
<span class="ind1">Well mayst thou claim the sun-god's chariot bright.</span><br />
Listen, new star, new regent of the day,<br />
<span class="ind1">Who with unwonted radiance gilds our heaven,</span><br />
<span class="ind1">O listen, goddess, to the prayers we pray!</span><br />
Let so much splendor from thy sphere be riven<br />
<span class="ind1">That to these eyes, which fain would weep alway,</span><br />
<span class="ind1">Unblinded, thy glad sight may yet be given!&quot;</span>
</td>

<p>From that moment Lorenzo began to write poems. He wandered alone and
meditated on the sunflower, playing delightfully unto himself with
thoughts of Love and Death. Yet his heart was empty; and like Augustine
or Alastor, he could say: &quot;nondum amabam, sed amare amabam, qu&#230;rebam
quod amarem amans amare.&quot; When a young man is in this mood it is not
long before he finds an object for his adoration. Lorenzo went one day
in the same spring with friends to a house of feasting, where he met
with a lady lovelier in his eyes even than La Simonetta. After the
fashion of his age, he describes her physical and mental perfections
with a minuteness which need not be enforced upon a modern reader.<a name="FNanchor_471_472" id="FNanchor_471_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_472" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>
Suffice it to say that Lucrezia Donati&#8212;such was the lady's
name&#8212;supplied Lorenzo with exactly what he had been seeking, an object
for his literary exercises. The <i>Sonetti</i>, <i>Canzoni</i>, and <i>Selve
d'Amore</i> were the fruits of this first passion.</p>

<p>Though Lorenzo was neither a poet nor a lover after the stamp of Dante,
these juvenile verses and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">-376-</a></span> prose with which he prefaced them, show
him in a light that cannot fail to interest those who only know the
statesman and the literary cynic of his later years. There is sincere
fervor of romantic feeling in the picture of the evening after
Simonetta's funeral, even though the analytical temper of the poet's
mind is revealed in his exact description of the shadow cast by the
planet he was watching. The first meeting with Lucrezia, again, is
prettily described in these stanzas of the <i>Selve</i>:</p>

Air, earth, and heavens were linked in one delight;<br />

Gladdened the earth where ran a streamlet bright,<br />
While Venus in her father's bosom lay<br />
And smiled from heaven upon the spot that day.<br />
<br />
She from her brows divine and amorous breast<br />
Took with both hands roses of many a hue,<br />

Covering my lady with their gracious dew;<br />

Fair women to that music moved their feet,<br />

<p>The impression of these verses is hardly marred by the prosy catalogue
of Lucrezia's beauties furnished in the <i>Innamoramento</i>. Lorenzo was an
analyst. He could not escape from that quality so useful to the
observer, so fatal to artists, if they cannot recompose the data
furnished by observation in a new subjective synthesis. When we compare
his description of the Age of Gold in the <i>Selve</i>,<a name="FNanchor_472_473" id="FNanchor_472_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_473" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> justly
celebrated for its brilliancy and wealth of detail, with the shorter
passage from Poliziano's <i>Stanze</i>, we measure the distance between
intelligent study of nature and the imagination which unifies and gives
new form of life to every detail. The same end may be more briefly
attained by a comparison of this passage about roses from Lorenzo's
<i>Corinto</i> with a musical <i>Ballata</i> of Poliziano<a name="FNanchor_473_474" id="FNanchor_473_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_474" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>:</p>

Rose-trees are planted there in order bright,<br />
<span class="ind1">Whereto I turned charmed eyes, and long did stay</span><br />
<span class="ind1">Taking my fill of that new-found delight.</span><br />
Red and white roses bloomed upon the spray;<br />
<span class="ind1">One opened, leaf by leaf, to greet the morn,</span><br />
<span class="ind1">Shyly at first, then in sweet disarray;</span><br />
Another, yet a youngling, newly born,<br />
<span class="ind1">Scarce struggled from the bud, and there were some</span><br />
<span class="ind1">Whose petals closed them from the air forlorn;</span><br />
Another fell, and showered the grass with bloom;<br />

Nor without peril can the branches raise<br />

<p>That is good. It is the best kind of poetry within Lorenzo's grasp. But
here is Poliziano's dance-song:</p>

<p>Both in this <i>Ballata</i> and also in the stanzas on the Age of Gold, it
might almost seem as though Poliziano had rewritten Lorenzo's exercise
with a view to showing the world the difference between true poetry and
what is only very like it.</p>

<p>The <i>Selve d'Amore</i> and the <i>Corinto</i> belong to Lorenzo's early manner,
when his heart was yet fresh and statecraft had not made him cynical.
The latter is a musical eclogue in <i>terza rima</i>; the former a discursive
love-poem, with allegorical episodes, in octave stanzas. Up to the date
of the <i>Selve</i> the <i>ottava rima</i> had, so far as I know, been only used
for semi-epical poems and short love-songs. Lorenzo proved his
originality by suiting it to a style of composition which aimed at
brilliant descriptions in the manner of Ovid. He also handled it with an
ease and brightness hitherto unknown. The pageant of Love and Jealousy
and the allegory of Hope in the second part are both such poetry as only
needed something magical from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">-380-</a></span> the touch of Ariosto to make them
perfect.<a name="FNanchor_474_475" id="FNanchor_474_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_475" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> As it is, Lorenzo's studies in verse produce the same
impression as Bronzino's in painting. They are brilliant, but hard,
cold, calculated, never fused by the final charm of poetry or music into
a delightful vision. What is lacking is less technical skill or
invention than feeling in the artist, the glow of passion, or the charm
of spiritual harmony. Here is a picture of Hope's attendant train:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">

Following this luckless dame, where'er she goes,<br />
Flit dreams in crowds, with auguries and lies,<br />

Whose forecast brings time flown before our eyes,<br />
Alchemy, all who heaven from our earth measure,<br />
And free conjectures made at will and pleasure.<br />
<br />
'Neath the dark shadow of her mighty wings<br />
The whole deluded world at last must cower:&#8212;<br />
O blindness that involves all mortal things,<br />
Frail ignorance that treads on human power!&#8212;<br />
He who can count the woes her empire brings,<br />
Could number every star, each fish, each flower,<br />
Tell all the birds that cross the autumnal seas,<br />
Of leaves that flutter from the naked trees.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>His <i>Ambra</i> is another poem in the same style as the <i>Selve</i>. It records
Lorenzo's love for that Tuscan farm which Poliziano afterwards made
famous in the sonorous hexameters he dedicated to the memory of
Homer.<a name="FNanchor_475_476" id="FNanchor_475_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_476" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> Following the steps of Ovid, Lorenzo feigns that a shepherd
Lauro loved the nymph Ambra, whom Umbrone, the river-god, pursued
through vale <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">-381-</a></span>and meadow to the shores of Arno. There he would have done
her violence, but that Diana changed her to a rock in her sore need:</p>

<p>This simile is characteristic both of Lorenzo's love for familiar
illustration, and also of the age that dawned on Michelangelo's genius.
In the same meter, but in a less ambitious style, is <i>La Caccia col
Falcone</i>. This poem is the simple record of a Tuscan hawking-party,
written to amuse Lorenzo's guests, but never meant assuredly to be
discussed by critics after the lapse of four centuries. These pastorals,
whether trifling like <i>La Caccia</i>, romantic like <i>Corinto</i>, or pictorial
like <i>Ambra</i>, sink into insignificance beside <i>La Nencia da
Barberino</i>&#8212;a masterpiece of true genius and humor, displaying intimate
knowledge of rustic manners, and using the dialect of the Tuscan
<i>contadini</i>.<a name="FNanchor_476_477" id="FNanchor_476_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_477" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> Like the <i>Polyphemus</i> of Theocritus, but with even
more of racy detail and homely fun, <i>La Nencia</i> versifies the
love-lament of a hind, Vallera, who describes the charms of his
sweetheart with quaint fancy, wooing her in a thousand ways, all
natural, all equally in keeping with rural simplicity. It can scarcely
be called a parody of village life and feeling, although we cannot fail
to see that the town is laughing at the country all through the
exuberant stanzas, so rich in fancy, so incomparably vivid in
description. What lifts it above parody is the truth of the picture and
the close imitation of rustic popular poetry<a name="FNanchor_477_478" id="FNanchor_477_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_478" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>:</p>

<p>These lines, chosen at random from the poem, might be paralleled from
<i>Rispetti</i> that are sung to-day in Tuscany. The vividness and vigor of
<i>La Nencia</i> secured for it immediate popularity. It was speedily
imitated by Luigi Pulci in the <i>Beca da Dicomano</i>, a village poem that,
aiming at cruder realism than Lorenzo's, broke the style and lapsed into
vulgarity. <i>La Nencia</i> long continued to have imitators; for one of the
principal objects of educated poets in the Renaissance was to echo the
manner of popular verse. None, however, succeeded so well as Lorenzo in
touching the facts of country life and the truth of country feeling with
a fine irony that had in it at least as much of sympathy as of sarcasm.</p>

<p><i>I Beoni</i> is a plebeian poem of a different and more displeasing type.
Written in <i>terza rima</i>, it distinctly parodies the style of the Divine
Comedy, using the same phrases to indicate action and to mark the turns
of dialogue; introducing similes in the manner of Dante,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">-383-</a></span> burlesquing
Virgil and Beatrice in the disgusting Bartolino and Nastagio.<a name="FNanchor_478_479" id="FNanchor_478_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_479" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The
poem might be called The Paradise of Drunkards, or their Hell; for it
consists of a succession of scenes in which intoxication in all stages
and topers of every caliber are introduced. The tone is coldly
satirical, sardonically comic. The old man of Tennyson's &quot;Vision of Sin&quot;
might have written <i>I Beoni</i> after a merry bout with the wrinkled
ostler. When Lorenzo composed it, he was already corrupt and weary,
sated with the world, worn with disease, disillusioned by a life of
compromise, hypocrisy, diplomacy, and treason to the State he ruled. Yet
the humor of this poem has nothing truly sinister or tragic. Its
brutality is redeemed by no fierce Swiftian rage. If some of the
descriptions in Lorenzo's earlier work remind us of Dutch flower and
landscape-painters, Breughel or Van Huysum, the scenes of <i>I Beoni</i>
recall the realism of Dutch tavern-pictures and Kermessen. It has the
same humor, gross and yet keen, the same intellectual enjoyment of
sensuality, the same animalism studied by an acute &#230;sthetic spirit.<a name="FNanchor_479_480" id="FNanchor_479_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_480" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p>To turn from <i>I Beoni</i> to Lorenzo's Lauds, written at his mother's
request, and to the sacred play of <i>S. Giovanni e Paolo</i>, acted by his
children, is to make one of those bewildering transitions which are so
common in Renaissance Italy. Without rating Lorenzo's sacred poetry very
high, either for religious fervor or &#230;sthetic quality, it is yet
surprising that the author of the <i>Beoni</i> and the Platonic sage of
Careggi should have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">-384-</a></span>caught so much of the pietistic tone. We know that
<i>S. Giovanni e Paolo</i> was written when he was advanced in years<a name="FNanchor_480_481" id="FNanchor_480_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_481" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>;
and the latent allusions to his illness and the cares of state which
weighed upon him, give it an interest it would not otherwise excite.

<p>seems to be a sigh from his own weariness. Lorenzo may not improbably
have envied Constantine, the puppet of his fancy, at the moment of
abdication. And yet when Savonarola called upon him ere his death to
deal justly with Florence, the true nature of the man was seen. Had he
liked it or not, he could not then have laid down the load of care and
crime which it had been the business of his whole life to accumulate by
crooked ways in the enslavement of Florence and the perdition of his
soul's peace. The Lauds, which may be referred to an earlier period of
Lorenzo's life, when his mother ruled his education, and the pious
Bishop of Arezzo watched his exemplary behavior in church with
admiration, have here and there in them a touch of profound
feeling<a name="FNanchor_481_482" id="FNanchor_481_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_482" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>; nor are they in all respects inferior to the average of
those included in the Florentine collection of 1863. The men of the
Renaissance were so constituted that to turn from vice, and cruelty, and
crime, from the deliberate corruption and enslavement of a people by
licentious pleasures and the persecution of an enemy in secret, with a
fervid and im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">-385-</a></span>passioned movement of the soul to God, was nowise
impossible. Their temper admitted of this anomaly, as we may plainly see
in Cellini's Autobiography. Therefore, though it is probable that
Lorenzo cultivated the Laud chiefly as a form of art, we are not
justified in assuming that the passages in which we seem to detect a
note of ardent piety, are insincere.</p>

<p>The versatility of Lorenzo's talent showed itself to greater advantage
when he quitted the uncongenial ground of sacred literature and gave a
free rein to his fancy in the composition of <i>Ballate</i> and Carnival
songs. This species of poetry offered full scope to a temperament
excessive in all pleasures of the senses.<a name="FNanchor_482_483" id="FNanchor_482_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_483" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> It also enabled him to
indulge a deeply-rooted sympathy with the common folk. Nor must it be
supposed that Lorenzo was following a merely artistic impulse. This
strange man, in whose complex nature opponent qualities were harmonized
and intertwined, made his very sensuality subserve his statecraft. The
Medici had based their power upon the favor of the proletariate. Since
the days of the Ciompi riot they had pursued one line of
self-aggrandizement by siding with the plebeians in their quarrels with
the oligarchs. The serious purpose which underlay Lorenzo's cultivation
of popular poetry, was to amuse the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">-386-</a></span> crowd with pageantry and music, to
distract their attention from State concerns and to blunt their
political interest, to flatter them by descending to their level and
mixing freely with them in their sports, and to acquire a popularity
which should secure him from the aristocratic jealousies of the
Acciaioli, the Frescobaldi, the Salviati, Soderini, and other ancestral
foemen of his house. The frontispiece to an old edition of Florentine
carnival songs shows him surrounded with maskers in quaint dresses,
leading the revel beneath the walls of the Palazzo, while women gaze
upon them from the windows.<a name="FNanchor_483_484" id="FNanchor_483_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_484" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> That we are justified in attributing a
policy of calculated enervation to Lorenzo is proved by the verdict of
Machiavelli and Guicciardini, both of whom connect his successful
despotism with the pageants he provided for the populace,<a name="FNanchor_484_485" id="FNanchor_484_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_485" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> and also
by this passage in Savonarola's treatise on the Government of Florence:
&quot;The tyrant, especially in times of peace and plenty, is wont to occupy
the people with shows and festivals, in order that they may think of
their own pastimes and not of his designs, and, growing unused to the
conduct of the commonwealth, may leave the reins of government in his
hands.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_485_486" id="FNanchor_485_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_486" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> At the same time he would err who should suppose that
Lorenzo's enjoyment of these pleasures, which he found <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">-387-</a></span>in vogue among
the people, was not genuine. He represented the worst as well as the
best spirit of his age; and if he knew how to enslave Florence, it was
because his own temperament shared the instincts of the crowd, while his
genius enabled him to clothe obscenity with beauty.</p>

<p>We know that it was an ancient Florentine custom for young men and girls
to meet upon the squares and dance, while a boy sang with treble voice
to lute or viol, or a company of minstrels chanted part-songs. The
dancers joined in the refrain, vaunting the pleasures of the May and the
delights of love in rhythms suited to the <i>Carola</i>. Taking this form of
poetry from the people, Lorenzo gave it the dignity of art. Sometimes he
told the tale of an unhappy lover, or pretended to be pleading with a
coy mistress, or broke forth into the exultation of a passion crowned
with success. Again, he urged both boys and girls to stay the flight of
time nor suffer the rose-buds of their youth to fade unplucked. In more
wanton moods, he satirized the very love he praised, or, casting off the
mask of decency, ran riot in base bestiality. These <i>Canzoni a Ballo</i>,
though they lack the supreme beauty of Poliziano's style, are
stylistically graceful. Their tone never rises above sensuality. Not
only has the gravity of Dante's passion passed away from Florence, but
Boccaccio's sensuous ideality is gone, and the <i>na&#239;vet&#233;</i> of popular
erotic poetry is clouded with gross innuendoes. We find in them the
&#230;esthetic immorality, the brilliant materialism of the Renaissance,
conveyed with careless self-abandonment to carnal impulse.</p>

<p>The name of Lorenzo de' Medici is still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">-388-</a></span> closely connected with the
<i>Canti Carnascialeschi</i> or Carnival Songs, of which he is said to have
been the first author, than with the <i>Ballate</i>, which he only used as
they were handed to him. In Carnival time it was the custom of the
Florentines to walk the streets, masked and singing satiric ballads.
Lorenzo saw that here was an opportunity for delighting the people with
the magnificence of pageantry. He caused the Triumphs in which he took a
part to be carefully prepared by the best artists, the dresses of the
maskers to be accurately studied, and their chariots to be adorned with
illustrative paintings. Then he wrote songs appropriate to the
characters represented on the cars. Singing and dancing and displaying
their costumes, the band paraded Florence. Il Lasca in his introduction
to the Triumphs and Carnival Songs dedicated to Don Francesco de' Medici
gives the history of their invention<a name="FNanchor_486_487" id="FNanchor_486_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_487" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>: &quot;This festival was invented
by the Magnificent Lorenzo de' Medici. Before his time, when the cars
bore mythological or allegorical masks, they were called <i>Trionfi</i>; but
when they carried representatives of arts and trades, they kept the
simpler name of <i>Carri</i>.&quot; The lyrics written for the Triumphs were
stately, in the style of antique odes; those intended to be sung upon
the <i>Carri</i>, employed plebeian turns of phrase and dealt in almost
undisguised obscenity. It was their wont, says Il Lasca, &quot;to go forth
after dinner, and often they lasted till three or four hours into the
night, with a multitude of masked men on horseback following, richly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">-389-</a></span>
dressed, exceeding sometimes three hundred in number and as many men on
foot with lighted torches. Thus they traversed the city, singing to the
accompaniment of music arranged for four, eight, twelve, or even fifteen
voices, supported by various instruments.&quot;</p>

<p>Lorenzo's fancy took the Florentine mind. From his days onward these
shows were repeated every year, the best artists and poets contributing
their genius to make them splendid. In the collection of songs written
for the Carnival, we find Masks of Scholars, Artisans, Frog-catchers,
Furies, Tinkers, Women selling grapes, Old men and Young wives,
Jewelers, German Lansknechts, Gypsies, Wool-carders, Penitents, Devils,
Jews, Hypocrites, Young men who have lost their fathers, Wiseacres,
Damned Souls, Tortoiseshell Cats, Perfumers, Masons, Mountebanks,
Mirror-makers, Confectioners, Prudent persons, Lawyers, Nymphs in love,
Nuns escaped from convent&#8212;not to mention the Four Ages of Man, the
Winds, the Elements, Peace, Calumny, Death, Madness, and a hundred
abstractions of that kind. The tone of these songs is uniformly and
deliberately immoral. One might fancy them composed for some old phallic
festival. Their wit is keen and lively, presenting to the fancy of the
student all the humors of a brilliant bygone age. A strange and splendid
spectacle it must have been, when Florence, the city of art and
philosophy, ran wild in Dionysiac revels proclaiming the luxury and
license of the senses! Beautiful maidens, young men in rich clothes on
prancing steeds, showers of lilies and violets, triumphal arches of
spring flowers and ribbons, hail-storms of comfits, torches flaring to
the sallow evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">-390-</a></span> sky&#8212;we can see the whole procession as it winds
across the Ponte Vecchio, emerges into the great square, and slowly
gains the open space beneath the dome of Brunelleschi and the tower of
Giotto. The air rings with music as they come, bass and tenor and shrill
treble mingling with the sound of lute and cymbal. The people hush their
cheers to listen. It is Lorenzo's Triumph of Bacchus, and here are the
words they sing:</p>

<p>On rolls the car, and the crowd closes round it, rending the old walls
with shattering hurrahs. Then a corner of the street is turned; while
soaring still above the hubbub of the town we hear at intervals that
musical refrain. Gradually it dies away in the distance, and fainter and
more faintly still the treble floats to us in broken waves of sound&#8212;the
echo of a lyric heard in dreams.</p>

<p>Such were the songs that reached Savonarola's ears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">-392-</a></span> writing or
meditating in his cloister at S. Marco. Such were the sights that moved
his indignation as he trod the streets of Florence. Then he bethought
him of his famous parody of the Carnival, the bonfire of Vanities and
the hymn in praise of divine madness sung by children dressed in white
like angels.<a name="FNanchor_487_488" id="FNanchor_487_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_488" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Yet Florence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">-393-</a></span> warned in vain by the friar, took no
thought for the morrow; and the morrow came to all Italy with war,
invasion, pestilence, innumerable woes. In the last year of Pier
Soderini's Gonfalonierato (1512) it seemed as though the Italians had
been quickened to a consciousness of their impending ruin. The siege of
Brescia, the battle of Ravenna, the League of Cambray, the massacres of
Prato, the sack of Rome, the fall of Florence, were all imminent. A
fascination of intolerable fear thrilled the people in the midst of
their heedlessness, and this fear found voice and form in a strange
Carnival pageant described by Vasari<a name="FNanchor_488_489" id="FNanchor_488_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_489" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>: &quot;The triumphal car was
covered with black cloth, and was of vast size; it had skeletons and
white crosses painted upon its surface, and was drawn by buffaloes, all
of which were totally black: within the car stood the colossal figure of
Death, bearing the scythe in his hand; while round him were covered
tombs, which opened at all the places where the procession halted, while
those who formed it, chanted lugubrious songs, when certain figures
stole forth, clothed in black cloth, on whose vestments the bones of a
skeleton were depicted in white; the arms, breast, ribs, and legs,
namely, all which gleamed horribly forth on the black beneath. At a
certain distance appeared figures bearing torches, and wearing masks
presenting the face of a death's head both before and behind; these
heads of death as well as the skeleton necks beneath them, also
exhibited to view, were not only painted with the utmost fidelity to
nature, but had besides a frightful expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">-394-</a></span> which was horrible to
behold. At the sound of a wailing summons, sent forth with a hollow moan
from trumpets of muffled yet inexorable clangor, the figures of the dead
raised themselves half out of their tombs, and seating their skeleton
forms thereon, they sang the following words, now so much extolled and
admired, to music of the most plaintive and melancholy character. Before
and after the car rode a train of the dead on horses, carefully selected
from the most wretched and meager animals that could be found: the
caparisons of those worn, half-dying beasts were black, covered with
white crosses; each was conducted by four attendants, clothed in the
vestments of the grave; these last-mentioned figures, bearing black
torches and a large black standard, covered with crosses, bones, and
death's heads. While this train proceeded on its way, each sang, with a
trembling voice, and all in dismal unison, that psalm of David called
the Miserere. The novelty and the terrible character of this singular
spectacle, filled the whole city, as I have before said, with a mingled
sensation of terror and admiration; and although at the first sight it
did not seem well calculated for a Carnival show, yet being new, and
within the reach of every man's comprehension, it obtained the highest
encomium for Piero as the author and contriver of the whole, and was the
cause as well as commencement of numerous representations, so ingenious
and effective that by these things Florence acquired a reputation for
the conduct of such subjects and the arrangement of similar spectacles
such as was never equaled by any other city.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">-395-</a></span></p>

<p>Of this Carnival song, composed by Antonio Alamanni, I here give an
English version.</p>

<p>These words sounded in the ears of the people, already terrified by the
unforgotten voice of Savonarola, like a trump of doom. The pageant was,
indeed, an acted allegory of the death of Italy, the repentance after
judgment of a nation fallen in its sins. Yet a few months passed, and
the same streets echoed with the music of yet another show, which has
also been described by Vasari.<a name="FNanchor_489_490" id="FNanchor_489_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_490" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> If the Car of Death expressed the
uneasy dread that fell on the Italians at the opening of the century,
the shows of 1513 allegorized their mad confidence in the fortune of the
age, which was still more deeply felt and widely shared. Giovanni de'
Medici had just been elevated to the Papal Chair, and was paying a
holiday visit to his native city. Giuliano de' Medici, his brother, the
Duke of Nemours, was also resident in Florence, where he had formed a
club of noble youths called the Diamond. Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, the
titular chief of the house, presided over a rival Company named Il
Broncone&#8212;with a withered laurel-branch, whence leaves were sprouting,
for its emblem. The Diamond signified the constancy of Casa Medici; the
withered branch their power of self-recovery. These two men, Giuliano
and Lorenzo, are the same who now confront each other upon their
pedestals in Michelangelo's Sacristy of S. Lorenzo. Both were doomed to
an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">-397-</a></span> untimely death; but in the year 1513, when Leo's election shed new
luster on their house, they were still in the heyday of prosperity and
hope. Giuliano resolved that the Diamond should make a goodly show.
Therefore he intrusted the invention and the poems to Andrea Dazzi, who
then held Poliziano's chair of Greek and Latin literature. Dazzi devised
three Cars after the fashion of a Roman triumph. For the construction of
each chariot an excellent architect was chosen; for their decoration the
painter Pontormo was appointed. In the first rode beautiful boys; in the
second, powerful men; in the third, reverend grandsires. Lorenzo, in
competition with his uncle, determined that the Laurel branch should
outrival the Diamond. He applied to Jacopo Nardi, the historian of
Florence and translator of Livy. Nardi composed a procession of seven
chariots to symbolize the Golden Age, and wrote appropriate poems for
each, which are still extant. In the first car rode Saturn and Janus,
attended by six shepherds of goodly form, naked, on horses without
harness. In the second sat Numa Pompilius, surrounded by priests in
antique raiment. The third carried Titus Manlius, whose consulship
beheld the close of the first Punic war. In the fifth Augustus sat
enthroned, accompanied by twelve laureled poets. The horses that drew
him, were winged. The sixth carried Trajan, the just emperor, with
doctors of the law on either side. All these chariots were adorned with
emblems painted by Pontormo. The seventh car held a globe to represent
the world. Upon it lay a dead man in a suit of rusty iron armor, from
the cloven plates of which emerged a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">-398-</a></span> living child, naked and gilt with
glistering leaf of gold. This signified the passing of the Iron, and the
opening of the Golden Age&#8212;the succession of the Renaissance to
feudalism&#8212;the fortunes of Italy reviving after her disasters in the
sunlight of the smiles of Leo. <i>Magnus s&#230;clorum nascitur ordo!</i> &quot;The
world's great age begins anew; the golden years return!&quot; Thus the
artists, scholars, and poets of Florence symbolized in a Carnival show
the advent of the Renaissance. The boy who represented the Golden Age,
died of the sufferings he endured beneath his gilding; and his father,
who was a baker, received ten scudi of indemnity. A fanciful historian
might read in this little incident the irony of fate, warning the
Italians that the age they welcomed would perish for them in its bloom.
In the year 1513 Luther was already thirty years of age, and Charles V.
in the Low Countries was a boy of thirteen, accumulating knowledge under
the direction of the future Adrian VI. Whatever destiny of gold the
Renaissance might through Italy be offering to Europe, it was on the
point of pouring blood and fastening heavier chains on every city of the
sacred land.</p>

<p>In my desire to bring together these three representative
festivals&#8212;Lorenzo's Triumph of Bacchus, Alamanni's Car of Death, and
Pontormo's Pageant of the Golden Age&#8212;marking three moments in the
Florentine Renaissance, and three diverse moods of feeling in the
people&#8212;I have transgressed the chronological limits of this chapter. I
must now return to the year 1464, when a boy of ten years old, destined
to revive the glories of Italian literature with far greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">-399-</a></span> luster
than Lorenzo, came from Montepulciano to Florence, and soon won the
notice of the Medicean princes. Angelo Ambrogini, surnamed Poliziano
from his home above the Chiana, has already occupied a prominent place
in this work.<a name="FNanchor_490_491" id="FNanchor_490_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_491" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> It is not, therefore, needful to retrace the history
of his uneventful life, or again to fix his proper rank among the
scholars of the fifteenth century. He was the greatest student, and the
greatest poet in Greek and Latin, that Italy has produced. In the
history of European scholarship, he stands midway between Petrarch and
Erasmus, taking the post of honor at the moment when erudition had
acquired ease and elegance, but had not yet passed on into the final
stage of scientific criticism. What concerns us here, is Poliziano's
achievement as an Italian poet. In the history of the vulgar literature
he fills a place midway between Petrarch and Ariosto, corresponding to
the station of distinction I have assigned to him in humanistic culture.
Of few men can it be said that they have held the same high rank in
poetry and learning; and had the moral fiber of Poliziano, his
intellectual tension and his spiritual aim, been at all commensurate
with his twofold ability, the Italians might have shown in him a fourth
singer equal in magnitude to their greatest. As it was, the excellence
of his work was marred by the defect of his temperament, and has far
less value for the general reader than for the student of versification.</p>

<p>Lorenzo de' Medici could boast of having restored the mother tongue to a
place of honor among the learned. But he was far from being the complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">-400-</a></span>artist that the age required. &quot;That exquisite flower of sentiment we
call good taste, that harmony of intellect we call judgment, lies not
within the grasp of power or riches.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_491_492" id="FNanchor_491_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_492" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> A man was needed who should
combine creative genius with refined tact in the use of language; who
should be competent to carry the tradition of Italian poetry beyond the
point where Boccaccio dropped it, while giving to his work the polish
and the splendor of a classic masterpiece. It was further necessary that
this new dictator of the literary commonwealth should have left the
Middle Age so far behind as not to be aware of its stern spirit. He must
have acquired the erudition of his eminently learned century&#8212;a century
in which knowledge was the pearl of great price; not the knowledge of
righteousness; not the knowledge of nature and her laws; but the
knowledge of the life that throbbed in ancient peoples, the life that
might, it seemed, yet make the old world young again. Moreover, he must
be strong enough to carry this erudition without bending beneath its
weight; dexterous enough to use it without pedantry; exuberant enough in
natural resources to reduce his stores of learning, his wealth of fancy,
his thronging emotions, to one ruling harmony&#8212;fusing all reminiscences
in one style of pure and copious Italian. He must be gifted with that
reverent sense of beauty, which was the sole survivirg greatness of his
century, animating the imagination of its artists, and justifying the
proud boast of its students. This man was found in Angelo Poliziano. He,
and only he, was destined, by combining the finish of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">-401-</a></span> classics with
the freshness of a language still in use, to inaugurate the golden age
of form. Faustus, the genius of the middle ages, had wedded Helen, the
vision of the ancient world. Their son, Euphorion, the inheritor of all
their gifts, we hail in Poliziano.</p>

<p>When Poliziano composed <i>Le Stanze</i> he was nearly twenty-four years of
age.<a name="FNanchor_492_493" id="FNanchor_492_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_493" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> He had steeped himself in the classic literatures. Endowed
with a marvelous memory, he possessed their spirit and their substance.
Not less familiar with Tuscan poetry of the fourteenth century, he
commanded the stores of Dante's, Petrarch's and Boccaccio's diction.
Long practice in Greek and Latin composition had given him mastery over
the metrical systems of the ancient languages.<a name="FNanchor_493_494" id="FNanchor_493_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_494" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> The daily habit of
inditing songs for music to please the ladies of the Medicean household,
had accustomed him to the use of fluent Italian. The translation of the
<i>Iliad</i>, performed in part before he was eighteen, had made him a
faithful imitator, while it added dignity and fullness to his
style.<a name="FNanchor_494_495" id="FNanchor_494_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_495" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Besides these qualifications for his future task of raising
Italian to an equality with Latin poetry, he brought with him to this
achieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">-402-</a></span>ment a genius apt to comprehend the spirit of the Renaissance in
its pomp and liberty and tranquil loveliness. The noble and yet sensuous
manner of the great Venetian painters, their dignity of form, their
luxury of color, their boldness and decision, their imperturbable
serenity of mundane joy&#8212;the choicer delicacy of the Florentine masters,
their refinement of outline, selection of type, suggestion of restrained
emotion&#8212;the pure design of the Tuscan sculptors, the suavity and
flexibility of the Lombard <i>plasticatori</i>&#8212;all these qualities of
Italian figurative art appear, as it were in bud, in the <i>Stanze</i>.
Poliziano's crowning merit as a stylist was that he knew how to blend
the antique and the romantic, correct drawing with fleshly fullness.
Breadth of design and harmony of color have rarely been produced in more
magnificent admixture. The octave stanza, which in the hands of
Boccaccio was languid and diffuse, in the hands of Lorenzo harsh, in the
hands of Pulci rugged, became under Poliziano's treatment an
inexhaustible instrument of varying melodies. At one time, beneath his
touch, the meter takes an epic dignity; again it sinks to idyllic
sweetness, or mourns with the elegy, or exults with the ode. Its
movement is rapid or relaxed, smooth or vibrating, undulatory or
impetuous, as he has chosen. When we reflect how many generations of
poets it required to bring the Sonnet to completeness, we may marvel at
this youth, in an age when scholarship absorbed inventive genius, who
was able at one stroke to do for the octave stanza what Marlowe did for
our Blank Verse. Poliziano gave to Ariosto the Italian epical meter
perfected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">-403-</a></span> and established a standard of style amid the anarchy which
threatened the literature of Italy with ruin.</p>

<p>Yet it must be confessed that, after all, it is chiefly the style of
Poliziano that deserves praise. Like so much else of Renaissance
work&#8212;like the Farnesina frescoes in Rome, or Giulio Romano's luxuriant
arabesques at Mantua, or the efflorescence of foliage and cupids in the
bass-reliefs of palace portals at Venice&#8212;there is but little solid
thought or serious feeling underneath this decorative richness. Those
who cannot find a pleasure in form for its own sake, independent of
matter, will never be able to do Poliziano justice. This brings us to
the subject of the <i>Stanze</i>. They were written to celebrate the prowess
of Giuliano de' Medici, Lorenzo's brother, in a tournament held at
Florence in the beginning of the year 1478. This fact is worth
consideration. The poem which opened a new age for Italian literature,
had no nobler theme than a Court pageant. Dante had been inspired to
sing the epic of the human soul. Petrarch finished a portrait of the
life through love of an impassioned man. Boccaccio bound up in one
volume a hundred tales, delineating society in all its aspects. Then the
Muse of Italy fell asleep. Poliziano aroused her with the full deep
intonations of a golden instrument. But what was the burden of his song?
Giuliano de' Medici loved the fair Simonetta, and bore away the prize in
a toy-tournament.</p>

<p>This marks the change effected by a century of prince-craft. Henceforth
great poets were to care less for what they sang than for the style in
which they sang. Henceforth poetry in Italy was written to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">-404-</a></span> please&#8212;to
please patrons who were flattered with false pedigrees and absurd
mythologies, with the imputation of virtues they never possessed, and
with the impudent palliation of shame apparent to the world. Henceforth
the bards of Ausonia deigned to tickle the ears of lustful boys and
debauched cardinals, buying the bread of courtly sloth&#8212;how salt it
tasted let Tasso and Guarini tell&#8212;with jests or panegyrics. Liberty
could scarcely be named in verse when natives and strangers vied
together in enslaving Italy. To praise the great deeds of bygone heroes
within hearing of pusillanimous princes, would have been an insult. Even
satires upon a degraded present, aspirations after a noble future,
prophecies of resurrection from the tomb&#8212;those last resorts of a
national literature that retains its strength through evil days&#8212;were
unknown upon the lips of the Renaissance poets. Art had become a thing
of pleasure, sometimes infamous, too often nugatory. The fault of this
can scarcely be said to have rested with one man more than with another;
nor can we lay the blame on Poliziano, though he undoubtedly represented
the class who were destined to continue literature upon these lines. It
was the combined result of scholarship, which for a whole century had
diverted the minds of men to the form and words of literature; of
court-life, which had enfeebled the recipients of princely patronage; of
tyranny, which encouraged flattery, dissimulation, and fraud; of foreign
oppression, which already was beginning to enervate a race of slaves; of
revived paganism, which set the earlier beliefs and aspirations of the
soul at unequal warfare with emancipated lusts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">-405-</a></span> sensualities; of
indolence, which loved to toy with trifles, instead of thinking and
creating thought; of social inequalities, which forced the poet to eat a
master's bread, and turned the scholars of Italy into a crowd of servile
and yet arrogant beggars. All these circumstances, and many more of the
same kind, were slowly and surely undermining the vigor of the Italian
intellect. Over the meridian splendor of <i>Le Stanze</i> we already see
their influences floating like a vaporous miasma.</p>

<p>Italy, though never so chivalrous as the rest of Europe, yet preserved
the pompous festivities of feudalism. Jousts were held in all great
cities, and it was reckoned part of a courtier's business to be a
skillful cavalier. At Florence the custom survived of celebrating the
first of May with tournaments, and on great occasions the wealthy
families spent large sums of money in providing pastimes of this sort.
February 7, 1468, witnessed a splendid spectacle, when Lorenzo de'
Medici, mounted successively on chargers presented to him by the Duke of
Ferrara and the King of Naples, attired in armor given by the Duke of
Milan, bearing the <i>fleurs de lys</i> of France conferred upon the Medici
by Louis XI., and displaying on his pennon for a motto <i>Le Tems
revient</i>, won the prize of valor before the populace assembled in the
square of S. Croce. Luca Pulci, the descendant of an ancient house of
Tuscan nobles, composed an adulatory poem in octave stanzas on this
event. So changed were the times that this scion of Florentine
aristocracy felt no shame in fawning on a despot risen from the people
to enslave his city. Yet the spectacle was worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">-406-</a></span> celebration. Lorenzo,
the banker's son, the Platonist, the diplomatist and tyrant, charging in
the lists of feudalism beneath Arnolfo's tower, with the lilies of
France upon his shield and the device of the Renaissance on his
banner&#8212;this figured symbol of the meeting of two ages in a single man
was no mean subject for a poem!</p>

<p>From Poliziano's <i>Stanze</i> we learn no such characteristic details
concerning Giuliano's later tournament. Though the poem is called <i>La
Giostra</i>, the insignificant subject disappears beneath a wealth of
illustration. The episodes, including the pictures of the Golden Age and
of the garden and palace of Venus, form the real strength of a
masterpiece which blent the ancient and the modern world in a work of
art glowing with Italian fancy. That <i>La Giostra</i> has no subject-matter,
no theme of weight to wear the poet thin through years of anxious toil,
no progress from point to point, no chain of incidents and no romantic
evolution, is a matter of little moment. When Giuliano de' Medici died
before the altar by the hand of an assassin on April 26, 1478, Poliziano
laid down his pen and left the <i>Stanze</i> unfinished.<a name="FNanchor_495_496" id="FNanchor_495_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_496" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> It cannot be
said that the poem suffered, or that posterity lost by this abrupt
termination of a work conceived without a central thought. Enough had
been already done to present Italy with a model of the style she needed;
and if we ask why <i>La Giostra</i> should have become imme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">-407-</a></span>diately popular
in spite of its peculiar texture and its abrupt conclusion, the answer
is not far to seek. Poliziano incarnated the spirit of his age, and gave
the public what satisfied their sense of fitness. The three chief
enthusiasms of the fifteenth century&#8212;for classical literature, for
artistic beauty, and for nature tranquilly enjoyed&#8212;were so fused and
harmonized within the poet's soul as to produce a style of unmistakable
originality and charming ease. Poliziano felt the delights of the
country with serene idyllic rapture, not at second hand through the
ancients, but with the voluptuous enjoyment of the Florentine who loved
his villa. He had, besides, a sense of form analogous to that possessed
by the artists of his age, which guided him in the selection and
description of the scenes he painted. Again, his profound and refined
erudition enabled him &quot;to shower,&quot; as Giovio phrased it, &quot;the finest
flowers of antique poetry upon the people.&quot; Therefore, while he felt
nature like one who worshiped her for her own sake and for the joy she
gave him, he saw in her the subjects of a thousand graceful pictures,
and these pictures he studied through a radiant haze of antique
reminiscences. Each stanza of <i>La Giostra</i> is a mimic world of beauty,
art, and scholarship; a painting where the object stands before us
modeled with relief of light and shade in finely modulated hues; a brief
anthology of daintily-culled phrases, wafting to our memories the
perfume of Greece, Rome, and Florence in her prime. These delicate
little masterpieces are, turn by turn, a picture of Botticelli, a fresco
by Giulio Romano, an engraving of Mantegna, a bass-relief of young
Buonarroti, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">-408-</a></span> garden-scene of Gozzoli, expressed in the purest
diction of all literatures by a poet who, while imitating, never ceased
to be original.<a name="FNanchor_496_497" id="FNanchor_496_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_497" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Nothing more was needed by a nation of idyllic
dreamers, artists and scholars.</p>

<p>What Poliziano might have achieved, if he had found a worthy theme for
the employment of his powers, it would be idle to ask. It is perhaps the
condemnation of the man and of his age that the former did not seek
heroic subjects for song, and the latter did not demand them&#8212;in a word
that neither poet nor public had in them anything heroic whatsoever. The
fact is undeniably true; but this does not deprive Poliziano of the
merit of such verses as the following:</p>

<p>A somewhat earlier composition than <i>La Giostra</i> was <i>La Favola di
Orfeo</i>, a dramatic poem similar in form to the <i>Sacra Rappresentazione</i>,
with a classical instead of a religious subject.<a name="FNanchor_497_498" id="FNanchor_497_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_498" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> To call it a
tragedy would be to dignify it with too grand a title. To class it with
pastorals is equally impossible, though the songs of the shepherds and
wood-nymphs may be said to have anticipated the style of Tasso's
<i>Aminta</i> and Guarini's <i>Pastor Fido</i>. Nor again is it properly speaking
an opera, though it was undoubtedly meant for music. The <i>Orfeo</i>
combined tragedy, the pastoral, and the opera in a mixed work of
melodramatic art, which by its great popularity inspired the poets of
Italy to produce specimens of each kind, and prepared the public to
receive them.<a name="FNanchor_498_499" id="FNanchor_498_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_499" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Still, in form and movement, it adhered to the
traditions of the <i>Sacra Rappresenta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">-410-</a></span>zione</i>, and its originality
consisted in the substitution of a Pagan for a Christian fable.</p>

<p>Unerring instinct guided Poliziano in the choice of his subject. Orpheus
was the proper hero of Renaissance Italy&#8212;the civilizer of a barbarous
world by art and poetry, the lover of beauty, who dared to invade Hell
and moved the iron heart of Pluto with a song. Long before the
composition of <i>Orfeo</i>, Boccaccio had presented the same conception of
society humanized by culture in his <i>Ninfale Fiesolano</i>. This was the
ideal of the Renaissance; and, what is more, it accurately symbolized
the part played by Italy after the dissolution of the middle ages. In
the myth of Orpheus the humanism of the Revival became conscious of
itself. This fable was the Mystery of the new age, the allegory of the
work appointed for the nation. Did we dare to press a metaphor to the
verge of the fantastic, we might even read in the martyrdom of Orpheus
by the M&#230;nads a prophecy of the Italian doom. Italy, who had aroused
Europe from lethargy with the voice of poetry and learning, who had
inaugurated a new age of civil and social refinement, who thought she
could resist the will of God by arts and elegant accomplishments, after
triumphing over the rude forces of nature was now about to violate the
laws of nature in her vices, and to fall a victim to the M&#230;nads of
incurrent barbarism, inebriate with wine and blood, indifferent to the
magic of the lyre, avengers blindly following the dictates of a power
that rules the destinies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">-411-</a></span> of nations. Of this Italy, Poliziano, the
author of <i>Orfeo</i>, was himself the representative hero, the protagonist,
the intellectual dictator.<a name="FNanchor_499_500" id="FNanchor_499_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_500" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Orfeo</i> was sent with a letter of dedication to Messer Carlo Canale,
the obsequious husband of that Vannozza, who bore Cesare and Lucrezia
Borgia to the Pope Alexander VI. Poliziano says that he &quot;wrote this play
at the request of the Most Reverend the Cardinal of Mantua, in the space
of two days, among continual disturbances, and in the vulgar tongue,
that it might be the better comprehended by the spectators.&quot; He adds:
&quot;This child of mine is of a sort to bring more shame than honor on its
father.&quot;</p>

<p>There is good reason to believe that the year 1472, when the Cardinal
Francesco Gonzaga returned from Bologna to Mantua, and was received with
&quot;triumphs and pomps, great feasts and banquets,&quot; was the date of its
composition. If so, the <i>Orfeo</i> was written at the age of eighteen. It
could not have been played later than 1483, for in that year the
Cardinal died. At eighteen Poliziano was already famous for his
translation of the <i>Iliad</i>. He had gained the title of <i>Homericus
Juvenis</i>, and was celebrated for his powers of improvization.<a name="FNanchor_500_501" id="FNanchor_500_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_501" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> That
he should have put the <i>Orfeo</i> together in forty-eight hours is hardly
so remarkable as that he should have translated Herodian in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">-412-</a></span>space
of a few days, while walking and dictating. For the <i>Orfeo</i> is but a
slight piece, though beautiful and pregnant with the germs of many
styles to be developed from its scenes. The plot is simple, and the
whole play numbers no more than 434 lines.</p>

<p>To do the <i>Orfeo</i> justice, we ought to have heard it with its own
accompaniment of music. Viewed as a tragedy, judged by the standard of
our Northern drama, it will always prove a disappointment. That mastery
over the complex springs of human nature which distinguished the first
efforts of Marlowe, is almost wholly absent. A certain adaptation of the
language to the characters, in the rudeness of Thyrsis when contrasted
with the rustic elegance of Arist&#230;us; a touch of feeling in Eurydice's
outcry of farewell; a discrimination between the tender sympathy of
Proserpine and Pluto's stern relenting; a spirited representation of
Bacchanalian enthusiasm in the M&#230;nads; an attempt to model the Satyr
Mnesillus as apart from human nature and yet conscious of its
anguish&#8212;these points constitute the chief dramatic features of the
melodrama. But where there was the opportunity of a really tragic
movement, Poliziano failed. We have only to read the lament uttered by
Orpheus for the loss of Eurydice, in order to perceive how fine a
situation has been spoiled. The pathos which might have made us
sympathize with the lover in his misery, the passion approaching frenzy
which might have justified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">-413-</a></span> his misogyny, are absent. Poliziano seems to
have already felt the inspiration of the Bacchic chorus which concludes
the play, and to have forgotten his duty to his hero, whose sorrow for
Eurydice is stultified and made unmeaning by the prosaic expression of a
base resolve. Yet, when we return from these criticisms to the real
merit of the piece, we find in it a charm of musical language, a
subtlety of musical movement, which are irresistibly fascinating.
Thought and feeling seem alike refined to a limpidity that suits the
flow of melody in song. The very words evaporate and lose themselves in
floods of sound. Orpheus himself is a purely lyrical personage. Of
character, he can scarcely be said to have anything marked; and his part
rises to its height precisely in the passage where the singer has to be
displayed. Thus the <i>Orfeo</i> is a good poem only where the situation is
less dramatic than lyrical, and its finest scene was, fortunately for
the author, one in which the dramatic motive could be lyrically
expressed. Before the gates of Hades and the throne of Proserpine,
Orpheus sings, and his singing is the right outpouring of a
musician-poet's soul. Each octave resumes the theme of the last stanza
with a swell of utterance, a <i>crescendo</i> of intonation, that recalls the
passionate and unpremeditated descant of a bird upon the boughs alone.
To this true quality of music is added the persuasiveness of pleading.
Even while we read, the air seems to vibrate with pure sound, and the
rich recurrence of the tune is felt upon the opening of each successive
stanza. That the melody of this incomparable song is lost, must be
reckoned a misfortune. We have reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">-414-</a></span> believe that the part of
Orpheus was taken by Messer Baccio Ugolini, singing to the viol.<a name="FNanchor_501_502" id="FNanchor_501_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_502" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>Space does not permit me to detach the whole scene in Hades from the
play and print it here; to quote a portion of it would be nothing less
than mutilation.<a name="FNanchor_502_503" id="FNanchor_502_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_503" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> I must content myself with this Chorus of the
M&#230;nads, which contains, as in a kernel, the whole dithyrambic poetry of
the Italians:</p>

<p>It remains to speak of the third class of poems which the great scholar
and supple courtier flung like wild flowers with a careless hand from
the chariot of his triumph to the Capitolian heights of erudition. Small
store, indeed, he set by them&#8212;these Italian love-songs, hastily
composed to please Donna Ippolita Leoncina, the titular mistress of his
heart; thrown off to serve the turn of Giuliano and his younger friends;
or improvised, half jestingly, to meet the humor of his princely patron,
when Lorenzo, quitting the laurel-crowned bust of Plato, or the groves
of Careggi, or the audience-chamber where he parleyed with the envoys of
the Sforza, went abroad like King Manfred of old with lute and mandoline
and viol to serenade the windows of some facile beauty in the twilight
of a night of June.<a name="FNanchor_503_504" id="FNanchor_503_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_504" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Little did Poliziano dream that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">-416-</a></span> learning
would pass away almost unreckoned, but that men of after time would
gather the honey of the golden days of the Renaissance from these
wilding garlands.<a name="FNanchor_504_505" id="FNanchor_504_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_505" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Yet, however slightly Poliziano may have prized
these productions of his early manhood, he proved that the <i>Canzone</i>,
the <i>Rispetto</i>, and the <i>Ballata</i> were as much his own in all their
multiformity of lyric loveliness, as were the rich sonorous measures of
the octave stanza. Expressing severally the depths of tender emotion,
the caprices of adoring passion, and the rhythmic sentiment that winds
in myriad movements of the dance, these three kinds of poem already
belonged to the people and to love. Poliziano displayed his inborn taste
and mastery of art in nothing more than in the ease with which he
preserved the passionate simplicity of the Tuscan <i>Volkslied</i>, while
giving it a place among the lyrics of the learned. We have already seen
how that had been achieved by Boccaccio and Sacchetti, and afterwards in
a measure by Lorenzo de' Medici. But the problem of writing love-poetry
for the people in their own forms, without irony and innuendo, was not
now so easy as it had been in the fourteenth century, when no barrier
had yet arisen between educated poets and the folk. Nor had even
Boccaccio, far less Lorenzo, solved it with the exquisite tact and
purity of style we find in all Poliziano's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">-417-</a></span> verses. In order to
comprehend their charm, we must transfer ourselves to Florence on a
summer night, when the prince is abroad upon the streets attended by
singing-boys as beautiful as Sandro's angels. The professor's chair is
forgotten, and Plato's spheres are left to turn unheeded. Pulci and
Poliziano join hands with girls from the workshop and the attic. Lorenzo
and Pico figure in the dance with 'prentice-lads and carvers of
wood-work or marble. All through the night beneath the stars the music
of their lutes is ringing; and when the dancing stops, they gather round
some balcony, or hold their own upon the square in matches of improvised
melody with the unknown rhymsters of the people. What can be prettier
than the ballad of roses made for &quot;such a night,&quot; by Angelo
Poliziano?<a name="FNanchor_505_506" id="FNanchor_505_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_506" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>Poliziano's <i>Rispetti</i> are written for the most part in <i>ottava rima</i>.
This form alone suffices to mark them out as literary reproductions of
the poetry upon which they are modeled. In the <i>Rispetti</i> more than the
<i>Ballate</i> we notice a certain want of <i>na&#239;vet&#233;</i>, which distinguishes
them from the racier inspirations of the popular Muse. That passionate
insight into the soul and essence of emotion which rarely fails the
peasant in his verse however rude, is here replaced by <i>concetti</i>
rounded into pearls of fancy with the daintiest art. Those brusque and
vehement images that flash the light of imagination on the movements of
the heart, throbbing with intensest natural feeling, yield to carefully
selected metaphors developed with a strict sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">-418-</a></span> of economy. Instead of
the young <i>contadino</i> willing to mortgage Paradise for his <i>dama</i>,
worshiping her with body, will and soul, compelling the morning and the
evening star and the lilies of the field and the bells that swing their
notes of warning over Rome, to serve the bidding of his passion, we have
the scholar-courtier, who touches love with the finger-tips for pastime,
and who imitates the gold of the heart with baser metal of fine
rhetoric. Still we find in these <i>Rispetti</i> a quality which their rustic
models lack. This is the roseate fluency and honeyed rapture of their
author&#8212;an exquisite limpidity and ease of diction that reveal the
inborn gift of art. Language in Poliziano's hand is plastic, taking form
like softest wax, so that no effort of composition, no labor of the file
can be discerned.</p>

<p class="center">Nec pluteum c&#230;dit nec demorsos sapit ungues.</p>

<p>This line of Persius denotes the excellences no less than the faults of
his erotic poetry, so charming in its flow, so fit to please a facile
ear, so powerless to stir the depth of the soul or wring relenting from
reluctant hearts. Compared with the love-poetry of elder poets, these
<i>Rispetti</i> are what the artificial epigrams of Callimachus or the
Anacreontics of the Alexandrian versifiers were to the ardent stanzas of
Sappho, the impassioned scolia of Pindar. While they fail to reflect the
ingenuous emotions of youth exulting in the Paradise of love without an
afterthought, they no less fail to embody philosophy or chivalrous
religion or the tragedy of passions in con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">-419-</a></span>flict. They are inspired by
Aphrodit&#233; Pandemos, and the joys of which they tell are carnal.<a name="FNanchor_506_507" id="FNanchor_506_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_507" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>What has been said about the detached <i>Rispetti</i>, is true of those
longer poems which consist of many octave stanzas strung together with a
continuity of pleading rhetoric. The facility bordering on negligence of
their construction is apparent. Verses that occur in one, reappear in
others without alteration. All repeat the same arguments, the same
enticements to a less than lawful love. The code of Florentine wooing
may be conveniently studied in the rambling paragraphs, while the levity
of their declarations and the fluency of their vows, doing the same
service on different occasions, show them to be &quot;false as dicers'
oaths,&quot; mere verses of the moment, made to sway a yielding woman's
heart.<a name="FNanchor_507_508" id="FNanchor_507_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_508" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Yet who can help enjoying them, when he connects their
effusiveness of fervent language with the episodes of the <i>Novelle</i>,
illustrated by figures borrowed from contemporary frescoes? Those sinewy
lads of Signorelli and Masuccio, in parti-colored hose and tight
jackets, climbing mulberry-tree or vine beneath their lady's window;
those girls with the demure eyes of Lippo Lippi and Bandello, suspending
rope-ladders from balconies to let their Romeo escape at daybreak: those
lovers rushing, half-clad in shirt or jerkin, from bower and bed-chamber
to cross their swords with jealous husbands at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">-420-</a></span>street corners; rise
before us and sing their love-songs in these verses of Poliziano,
written for precisely such occasions to express the very feelings of
these heroes of romance. After all, too, there is a certain sort of
momentary sincerity in their light words of love.</p>

<p>Three lyrics of higher artistic intention and of very different caliber
mark the zenith of Poliziano's achievement. These are the portrait of
the country girl, <i>La brunettina mia</i>; the canzone to <i>La Bella
Simonetta</i>, written for Giuliano de' Medici; and the magnificent
imitation of Petrarch's manner, beginning <i>Monti, valli, antri e
colli</i>.<a name="FNanchor_508_509" id="FNanchor_508_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_509" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> They are three studies in pictorial poetry, transparent,
limpid, of incomparable freshness. A woman has sat for the central
figure of each, and the landscape round her is painted with the delicacy
of a <i>quattrocento</i> Florentine. <i>La Brunettina</i> is the simple village
beauty, who bathes her face in the fountain, and crowns her blonde hair
with a wreath of wild flowers. She is a blossoming branch of thorn in
spring. Her breasts are May roses, her lips are strawberries. The
portrait is so ethereally tinted and so firmly modeled that we seem to
be looking at a study painted by a lover from the life. Simonetta moves
with nobler grace and a diviner majesty<a name="FNanchor_509_510" id="FNanchor_509_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_510" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>:</p>

<p>All the defined idealism, the sweetness and the purity of Tuscan
portraiture are in these stanzas. Simonetta does not pass by with a
salutation in a mist of spiritual glory like Beatrice. She is surrounded
with no flames of sensual desire like the Griselda of Boccaccio. She
sits for her portrait in a tranquil light, or moves across the canvas
with the dignity of a great lady:</p>

<p>It was a rare and fugitive moment in the history of art when Poliziano
could paint La Simonetta in these verses, and Lippo Lippi showed her
likeness on cathedral walls of Prato. Different models of feminine
beauty, different ideals of womanly grace served the painters and poets
of a more developed age; Titian's Flora and Dosso Dossi's Circe
illustrating the Alcina of Ariosto and the women of Guarini. Once more,
it is the thought of Simonetta which pervades the landscape of the third
canzone I have mentioned. Herself is absent; but, as in a lyric of
Petrarch, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">-423-</a></span> spirit is felt, and we are made to see her throned
beneath the gnarled beech-branches or dipping her foot in the too happy
rivulet. Something just short of perfection in the <i>staccato</i>
exclamations of the final trophe reminds us of Poliziano's most serious
defect. Amid so much tenderness of natural feeling, he fails to make us
believe in the reality of his emotion. Not passion, not thought, but the
refined sensuousness of a nature keenly alive to plastic beauty,
educated in the schools of classical and Florentine art, and gifted with
inexhaustible facility of language, is the dominant quality of
Poliziano's Italian poetry. The same quality is found in his Latin and
Greek verse&#8212;in the plaintive elegies for La Bella Simonetta and Albiera
degli Albizzi, in the <i>Viol&#230;</i> and in that ode <i>In puellam suam</i><a name="FNanchor_511_512" id="FNanchor_511_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_512" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
which is the Latin sister of <i>La brunettina</i>. The <i>Sylv&#230;</i> add a new
element of earnestness to his style; for if Poliziano felt deep and
passionate emotion, it was for Homer, Virgil and the poets praised in
the <i>Nutricia</i>, while the <i>Rusticus</i> condenses in one picture of
marvelous fullness the outgoings of genuine emotion stimulated by his
love of the country.</p>

<p>That is the heart-felt prayer of Poliziano. Give me the tranquil
scholar's life among the pleasures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">-424-</a></span> the fields; my books for serious
thought in studious hours; the woods and fields for recreation; with
moderate wealth well-gotten without toil; no bishop's miter or triple
tiara to vex my brows. It is the same ideal as Alberti's. From this
background of the modest rural life emerge three splendid visions&#8212;the
Golden Age, when all was plenitude and peace; Orpheus of the dulcet
lyre, evoking harmony from discord in man's jarring life; and Venus
rising from the waves to bless the world with beauty felt through art.
Such was the programme of human life sketched by the representative mind
of his century, in an age when the Italians were summoned to do battle
with France, Germany and Spain invasive of their borders.</p>

<p>Poliziano died before the great catastrophe. He sank at the meridian of
his fame, in the same month nearly as Pico, two years later than
Lorenzo, a little earlier than Ficino, in the year 1494, so fatal to his
country, the date that marks the boundary between two ages in Italian
history.</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lorenzo de&#8217; Medici</span> and Angelo Poliziano reunited the two currents of
Italian literature, plebeian and cultivated, by giving the form of
refined art to popular lyrics of divers kinds, to the rustic idyll, and
to the sacred drama. Another member of the Medicean circle, Luigi Pulci,
aided the same work of restoration by taking up the rude tales of the
<i>Cantori da Piazza</i> and producing the first romantic poem of the
Renaissance.</p>

<p>Of all the numerous forms of literature, three seem to have been
specially adapted to the Italians of this Period. They were the
<i>Novella</i>, the Romantic Epic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">-426-</a></span> and the Idyll. With regard to the
<i>Novella</i> and the Idyll, it is enough in this place to say that we may
reckon them indigenous to modern Italy. They suited the temper of the
people and the age; the <i>Novella</i> furnishing the fit artistic vehicle
for Italian realism and objectivity; the Idyll presenting a point of
contact with the literature of antiquity, and expressing that calm
sensibility to natural beauty which was so marked a feature of the
national character amid the distractions of the sixteenth century. The
Idyll and the <i>Novella</i> formed, moreover, the most precious portion of
Boccaccio's legacy.</p>

<p>Concerning the Romantic Epic it is necessary to speak at greater length.
At first sight the material of the Carolingian Cycle, which formed the
basis of the most considerable narrative poems of the Renaissance, seems
uncongenial to the Italians. Feudalism had never taken a firm hold on
the country. Chivalry was more a pastime of the upper classes, more
consciously artificial than it had been in France or even England. The
interest of the Italians in the Crusades was rather commercial than
religious, and the people were not stirred to their center by the
impulse to recover the Holy Sepulcher. The enthusiasm of piety which
animated the Northern myth of Charlemagne, was not characteristic of the
race that earlier than the rest of Europe had indulged in speculative
skepticism and sarcastic raillery; nor were the marvels of the legend
congenial to their positive and practical imagination, turned ever to
the beauties of the plastic arts. Charlemagne, again, was not a national
hero. It seemed as though the great foreign epics, which had been
trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">-427-</a></span>ported into Italy during the thirteenth century, would find no
permanent place in Southern literature after the close of the
fourteenth. The cultivated classes in their eagerness to discover and
appropriate the ancient authors lost sight of peer and paladin. Even
Boccaccio alluded contemptuously to chivalrous romance, as fit reading
only for idle women; and when he attempted an epical poem in octave
stanzas, he chose a tale of ancient Greece. Still, in spite of these
apparent drawbacks, in spite of learned scorn and polished indifference,
the Carolingian Cycle had taken a firm hold upon the popular fancy. We
have seen how a special class of literary craftsmen reproduced its
principal episodes in prose and verse for the multitudes gathered on the
squares to hear their recitations, or for readers in the workshop and
the country farm. Now, in the renascence of the native literature, poets
of the highest rank were destined to receive the same material from the
people and to give it a form appropriate to their own culture. This fact
must not be forgotten by the student of Pulci, Boiardo, Berni, and
Ariosto. The romantic epics of the golden age had a plebeian origin; and
the masters of verse who devoted their best energies to that brilliant
series of poems, were dealing with legends which had taken shape in the
imagination of the people, before they applied their own inventive
faculties to the task of beautifying them with art unrivaled for
splendor and variety of fancy. This, and this alone, explains the
anomalies of the Italian romantic epic&#8212;the mixture of burlesque with
seriousness, the irony and sarcasm alternating with gravity and pathos,
the wealth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">-428-</a></span> comic episodes, the interweaving of extraneous incidents,
the antithesis between the professed importance of the subject-matter
and the spirit of the poet who plays with it as though he felt its
puerility&#8212;all the startling contrasts, in a word, which have made this
glittering Harlequin of art in the Renaissance so puzzling to modern
critics. If we remember that the poets of the sixteenth century adopted
their subjects from the people, finding them already impregnated with
the plebeian instincts of <i>improvisatori</i>, who felt no real sympathy
with knighthood, and whose one aim was to amuse and gratify an audience
eager for excitement; if we further recollect that these poets
approached their own task in the same spirit, adding yet another element
of irony proper to men who stood aloof and laughed, and who desired to
entertain the Courts of Italy with masterpieces of humor and fantastic
beauty; we shall succeed in comprehending the peculiarities of their
productions.</p>

<p>The romances of Orlando must be regarded as works of pure art, wrought
by courtly singers from a previously existing popular literature, which
in its turn had been fashioned from the Frankish legends to suit the
tastes of a non-chivalrous, but humorous and marvel-loving multitude. In
passing from the Song of Roland or Turpin's Chronicle to the <i>Orlando
Furioso</i> we can trace two separate processes of transmutation. By the
earlier process the <i>materia di Francia</i> was adapted to the Italian
people; by the second the new material thus obtained was reconstructed
for the Italian Courts. The final product is a masterpiece of refined
art, retaining something of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">-429-</a></span> originals, something of the
popular Italian <i>rifacimento</i>, but superadding the wisdom, the irony,
and the poetry of one of the world's brightest geniuses. We might
compare the growth of a romantic epic of the sixteenth century to the
art of Calimala, whereby the rough stuffs of Flanders were wrought at
Florence into finer cloths, and the finished fabric was tinted with the
choicest dyes, and made fit for a king's chamber.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have spoken as though Pulci, Boiardo, Ariosto, Berni, and the
lesser writers of romantic epics could be classed together in one
sentence. The justification of so broad a treatment at the outset lies
in this, that their relation to the popular romances they rehandled was
substantially the same. But it will be the special purpose of the
following pages to point out their essential differences, not only as
poets, but also with regard to the spirit in which they viewed their
common subject-matter.</p>

<p>Boccaccio, in his desire to fuse the classic and the medieval modes of
thought and style, not merely adapted the periods of Latin to Italian
prose, but also sought to treat an antique subject in the popular
measure of the octave stanza. His <i>Teseide</i> is a narrative poem in which
the Greek hero plays a prominent part, while all the chiefs of Theban
and Athenian legend are brought upon the scene. Yet the main motive is a
tale of love, and the language is as modern as need be. Writing to
please the mistress of his heart, and emulous of epic fame, Boccaccio
rejected the usual apostrophes and envoys of the <i>Cantori da Banca</i>, and
constructed a poem divided into books. Poliziano approached the problem
of fusing the antique and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">-430-</a></span> modern from a different point of view. He
adorned a courtly theme of his own day with phrases and decorative
details borrowed from the classic authors, presenting in a series of
brilliant pictures an epitome of ancient art. It remained for Pulci to
develop, without classical admixture, the elements of poetry existing in
the popular Italian romances. The <i>Morgante Maggiore</i> is therefore more
thoroughly and purely Tuscan than any work of equal magnitude that had
preceded it. This is its great merit, and this gives it a place apart
among the hybrid productions of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>The Pulci were a noble family, reduced in circumstances and attached to
the Casa Medici by ties of political and domestic dependency. Bernardo,
the eldest of three brothers, distinguished himself in literature by his
translations of Virgil's Eclogues, by his elegies on Cosimo de' Medici,
by a <i>Sacra Rappresentazione</i> on the tale of Barlaam, and by a poem on
the Passion of Christ which he composed at the instance of a devout nun.
Luca wrote the stanzas on the Tournament of Lorenzo de' Medici above
mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_512_513" id="FNanchor_512_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_513" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> and took some part at least in the composition of an
obscure poem called the <i>Ciriffo Calvaneo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_513_514" id="FNanchor_513_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_514" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> But the most famous of
the brothers was Luigi, whose correspon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">-431-</a></span>dence with Lorenzo de' Medici
proves him to have been a kind of Court-poet in the Palace of the Via
Larga, while the sonnets he exchanged with Matteo Franco breathe
Burchiello's plebeian spirit.<a name="FNanchor_514_515" id="FNanchor_514_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_515" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> He had a wild fantastic temperament,
inclining to bold speculations on religious topics; tinctured with
curiosity that took the form of magic art; bizarre in expression, yet
withal so purely Florentine that his prose and verse are a precious mine
of <i>quattrocento</i> idioms gathered from the jargon of the streets and
squares. Of humanistic culture he seems to have possessed but little.
Still the terms of familiar intercourse on which he lived with Angelo
Poliziano, Matteo Palmieri, and Paolo Toscanelli enabled him to gather
much of the learning then in vogue. The theological and scientific
speculations of the age are transmitted to us in his comic stanzas with
a vernacular raciness that renders them doubly precious.<a name="FNanchor_515_516" id="FNanchor_515_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_516" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>Before engaging with the <i>Morgante Maggiore</i>, it is needful to inquire
into the source of this and all the other Italian romantic poems, and to
account for the fact that they were confined, so far as their subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">-432-</a></span>went, within the circle of the Carolingian epic. In 1122 a prose
history in monkish Latin, purporting to be the Chronicle of the last
years of the reign of Charles the Great written by Turpin, Archbishop of
Rheims, was admitted among the canonical books by Calixtus II., who in
his Bull cursed those who should thenceforward listen to the &quot;lying
songs of Jongleurs.&quot; This Chronicle was merely a sanctimonious and
prosaic version of the Songs of Roland and of Roncesvalles.<a name="FNanchor_516_517" id="FNanchor_516_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_517" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> The
object of the scribe who compiled it, and of the Pope who canonized it,
was to give an ecclesiastical complexion to the martial chants which
already possessed the ear of the public.<a name="FNanchor_517_518" id="FNanchor_517_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_518" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> Accordingly, while he left
untouched the tales of magic, the monstrous marvels and the unchristian
ethics of the elder fable, this pseudo-Turpin interspersed prayers,
confessions, vows, miracles, homilies, and pulpit admonitions. In order
to secure verisimilitude for his narrative, he reversed the old account
of Roncesvalles, according to which Turpin perished on the field,
anathematized all previous poets, and pretended that his Chronicle was
written by the hands of the Archbishop.<a name="FNanchor_518_519" id="FNanchor_518_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_519" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> What he effected for the

<p>We possess a MS. of the <i>Chanson de Roland</i> in Norman French. It was
discovered in the Bodleian Library and published first in 1837 by M.
Michel, afterwards in 1851 by M. G&#233;nin. The date of the MS. has been
fixed by some critics as early as the eleventh, by others as late as the
thirteenth, century. Purporting to be the work of one Turold, its most
enthusiastic admirers claim it as the genuine production of Th&#233;roulde,
tutor to William the Conqueror, which, after passing through the hands
of Taillefer, the knightly bard of Senlac field, was deposited in his
MS. chest by a second Th&#233;roulde, abbot of Peterborough.<a name="FNanchor_519_520" id="FNanchor_519_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_520" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> Be that as
it may, we can assume that the Bodleian MS. presents the ancient
battle-song in nearly the same form as when the Normans followed
Taillefer at Hastings, and heard him chanting of &quot;Charlemain and Roland
and Oliver who died in Roncesvalles.&quot; This song reverberated throughout
medieval Europe. Poggio in the <i>Faceti&#230;</i> compares a man who weeps over
the fall of Rome, to one who in Milan shed tears over Roland's death at
Roncesvalles. Dante may have heard it on the lips of the <i>Cantores
Francigenarum</i> in Lombard towns, or in the halls of Fosdinovo above the
Tyrrhene Sea; for he writes with an energy of style scarcely inspired by
the pseudo-Turpin:</p>

<p>Orlando and Oliver (or Ogier) are carved upon the fa&#231;ade of the Duomo at
Verona&#8212;Dietrich's town of Bern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">-434-</a></span> where Northern traditions of chivalry
long lingered.<a name="FNanchor_520_521" id="FNanchor_520_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_521" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> Like the Spanish legend of the Cid, or the climax of
the <i>Niebelungenlied</i>, this Song of Roland, in dignity and strength of
style, in tragic heroism and passionate simplicity, is worthy to be
ranked with a Canto of the <i>Iliad</i>. Like all medieval romantic poetry,
it is but a fragment&#8212;the portion of a cycle never wrought by
intervention of a Homer into epical completeness. But its superiority
over Turpin's Chronicle in all the qualities that could inspire a singer
is immeasurable.</p>

<p>Two questions have now to be asked. What historical basis can be found
for the Carolingian myth? and how did it happen that the Italians
preferred this legend of French Paladins to any other of the feudal
romances? The history of Charlemagne and his peers&#8212;of Roland, Oliver,
Ogier, Turpin, Ganilo the traitor, Pinabel, Marsilius the Moorish king
of Spain, and all the rest, of whom we read in the Norman Song, and who
receive numerous additions from the Italian romancers&#8212;must not be
sought in Eginhard. It is a Myth. But like all myths, it has some
nucleus of reality, round which have crystallized the enthusiasms of a
semi-barbarous age, the passionate memories of the people looking back
to bygone greatness, the glowing fancies of poets intent on visions of
the future. This nucleus of fact is little more than the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">-435-</a></span>
Charles the Frankish Emperor. All the legends of the cycle represent him
as conducting a crusade, defeating the Saracens in mighty battles,
besieged by them in Paris, betrayed by his own subject Ganilo, and
bereft of his noblest paladins in the Pass of Roncesvalles. History
knows nothing of these events. Nor can history account for the
traditional character of the Emperor, who is feeble, credulous,
browbeaten by lawless vassals, incapable of strenuous action, and yet
respected as the conqueror of the world and the anointed of the
Lord.<a name="FNanchor_521_522" id="FNanchor_521_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_522" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> It is therefore clear that the myth has blent together divers
incongruous elements, and that the spirit of the crusades has been at
work, giving a kind of unity to scarce remembered acts of the chief of
Christendom. We hear from Eginhard that Charlemagne in 778 advanced as
far as Saragossa into Spain, and during his retreat had his rearguard
cut off by the Basques.<a name="FNanchor_522_523" id="FNanchor_522_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_523" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Among the slain was &quot;Roland, prefect of the
Breton Marches.&quot; We read again in Eginhard (anno 824) how Louis le
Debonair lost two of his counts, who were returning from Spain through
the Pass of Roncesvalles. Furthermore, the Merovingian Chronicles tell
us of a Pyrenean battle in the days of Dagobert, when twelve Frankish
chiefs were surrounded in those passes and slain. These are sufficient
data to account for the Pass of Roncesvalles becoming a valley dolorous,
the vale of the great woe. For <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">-436-</a></span>the crusading exploits of Charlemagne we
have to look to his predecessor, Charles Martel, who defeated the
Saracens at Tours and stemmed the tide of Mussulman invasion. His
successors, the feeble monarchs of the Frankish line, several of whom
bore the name of Charles, explain the transformation of the Emperor into
a vacillating monarch, infirm of purpose and incapable of keeping his
peers in order; for the distinguishing surnames of history are later
additions, and Chronicles, though written, were not popularly read. The
bard, therefore, mixed his materials without care for criticism, and the
myth produced a hybrid Charlemagne composed of many royal Karls. As for
the traitor Gano, we hear of Lupus, Duke of Gascony, who dealt
treasonably with Charlemagne, and of one Ganilo, Ganelon, or Wenelon,
Archbishop of Sens, who played the same part toward Charles the Bald in
864.<a name="FNanchor_523_524" id="FNanchor_523_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_524" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> This portion of the myth may possibly be referred to these dim
facts. Yet it would be wiser not to insist upon them; for the endeavor
to rationalize an entire legend is always hazardous, and it is enough to
say that a traitor was needed for the fight of Roncesvalles no less than
Mordred for the death of Arthur in the plain of Glastonbury. To explain
the legendary siege of Paris by the Saracens, so important an incident
in the Italian romances, it has been ingeniously remarked that, though
the Moors never menaced the French capital, the Normans did so
repeatedly, while both Saracens and Normans were Pagans.<a name="FNanchor_524_525" id="FNanchor_524_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_525" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> It may
also <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">-437-</a></span>be remembered that Saracens had pillaged Rome, and the Saracen
forays were a common incident of Italian experience. The gathering of
great armies from the far East and the incursions of hideous barbarian
hordes, which form an integral element of Boiardo's and Ariosto's
scheme, can be referred to the memory of Tartar, Hun, and Turk; while
the episodes of Christian knights enamored of Pagan damsels are
incidents drawn from actual history in the intercourse of Italy with the
Levant. Allowing for this slight framework of fact, but not pressing
even the few points that have been gathered by antiquarian research, it
may be briefly said that the bulk of the Carolingian romance, with its
numerous subordinate legends of knights and ladies, is purely mythical.</p>

<p>In the next place we have to consider what led the Italians to select
the romances of Charlemagne for special development rather than those of
Arthur, with which they were no less familiar.<a name="FNanchor_525_526" id="FNanchor_525_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_526" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> We have seen that on
the first introduction of the <i>materia di Francia</i> into Italy, the
Arthurian Cycle became the property of the nobles, who found in it a
mirror of the feudal manners they affected, whereas the people listened
to <i>Chansons de Geste</i> upon the market-place.<a name="FNanchor_526_527" id="FNanchor_526_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_527" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> When, therefore, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">-438-</a></span>the
polite poets of the fifteenth century adopted the romantic epic from the
popular rhymers, they found a mass of Carolingian tales in vogue, to
which they had themselves from infancy been used. But this preference of
the multitude for Charlemagne and Roland requires further explanation.
It must be remarked in the first place that the Empire exercised a
fascination over the Italians in the middle ages, paralleled by no other
power except the Papacy. They regarded it as their own, as their glory
in the past, as their pride in the future, if only the inheritor of the
C&#230;sars would do his duty and rule the world from Rome with equal
justice. The pedigree of the Christian Emperors from Constantine to
Charles the Great formed an integral part of the Carolingian romance as
it took form in Italy.<a name="FNanchor_527_528" id="FNanchor_527_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_528" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> It was something for the Italians that
Charles had been crowned at Rome, a ceremony from time to time repeated
by his German successors during the centuries which made his legend
famous. Nor, though the people were but little influenced by the
crusading fanaticism, was it of no importance that in the person of this
Emperor Christendom had been imperiled by the infidels, and Christendom
through him had triumphed. The Chronicle of Turpin, again, had received
authoritative sanction. Add to it as the romancers chose, attribute
nonsense to the Archbishop as they pleased, they always relied, in show
at least, on his canonical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">-439-</a></span> veracity. Pulci, Bello, Boiardo, and Ariosto
appeal to his authority with mock seriousness; and even the burlesque
Berni, while turning Turpin into ridicule, adopts the style:</p>

<p>The fashion lasted till the days of Folengo and Fortiguerra. It may
further be mentioned that Orlando at an early date had been made a Roman
by the popular Italian mythologists. They said that he was born at
Sutri, and that Oliver was the son of the Roman prefect for the Pope.
The sentiment of the people for this strange <i>Senator Romanus</i> expressed
itself touchingly and pithily in his supposed epitaph: &quot;One God, One
Rome, One Roland.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_529_530" id="FNanchor_529_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_530" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Orlando was so rooted in the popular
consciousness as a hero, that to have substituted for him another epical
character would have been impossible.</p>

<p>When we further investigate the naturalization of Orlando in Italy, we
find that all the romantic poems written on his legend inclined to the
burlesque. The chivalrous element of love which pervades the Arthurian
Cycle, had been extracted and treated after their own <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">-440-</a></span>fashion by the
lyrists of the fourteenth century. That was no immediate concern of the
people, nor had the citizens any sympathy with the chivalry of arms. To
deal as solemnly with medieval romance as the Northern bards had done,
was quite beside the purpose of the <i>improvisatori</i> who refashioned the
<i>Chansons de Geste</i> for Italian townsfolk. When, therefore, Pulci
undertook to amuse Lucrezia Tornabuoni, the mother of Lorenzo de'
Medici, with a tale of Roland, he found his material already stripped of
epical sobriety; nor was it hard for him to handle his theme in the
spirit of Boccaccio, bent on exhausting every motive of amusement which
it might suggest. He assumed the tone of a street-singer, opening each
canto with the customary invocation to Madonna or a paraphrase of some
Church collect, and dismissing his audience at the close with grateful
thanks or brief good wishes. But Pulci was no mere <i>Cantastorie</i>. The
popular style served but for a cloak to cover his subtle-witted satire
and his mocking levity. Sarcastic Tuscan humor keeps up an <i>obbligato</i>
accompaniment throughout the poem. Sometimes this humor is in harmony
with the plebeian spirit of the old Italian romances; sometimes it turns
aside and treats it as a theme of ridicule. In reading the <i>Morgante</i>,
we must bear in mind that it was written, canto by canto, to be recited
in the Palace of the Via Larga, at the table where Poliziano and Ficino
gathered with Michelangelo Buonarroti and Cristoforo Landino. Whatever
topics may from time to time have occupied that brilliant circle, were
reflected in its stanzas; and this alone suffices to account for its
tender episodes and its burlesque extravagances, for the satiric picture
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">-441-</a></span> Margutte and the serious discourses of the devil Astarotte. The
external looseness of construction and the intellectual unity of the
poem, are both attributable to these circumstances. Passing by rapid
transitions from grave to gay, from pathos to cynicism, from theological
speculations to ribaldry, it is at one and the same time a mirror of the
popular taste which suggested the form, and also of the courtly wits who
listened to it laughing. The <i>Morgante</i> is no <i>na&#239;ve</i> production of a
simple age, but the artistic plaything of a cultivated and critical
society, entertaining its leisure with old-world stories, accepting some
for their beauty's sake in seriousness, and turning others into nonsense
for pure mirth.</p>

<p>A careful study of the <i>Morgante Maggiore</i> reveals to the critic three
separate strains of style. To begin with, it is clear that we are
dealing with two poems fused in one&#8212;the first ending with the
twenty-third canto, the second consisting of the last five cantos.
Between these two divisions a considerable period of time is supposed to
have elapsed. The first poem consists of a series of romantic adventures
in strange countries, whither Orlando, Uliviero, Rinaldo and Astolfo
have been driven by the craft of Gano, and where they fight giants,
liberate ladies, and fall in love with Pagan damsels, after the jovial
fashion of knights errant. The second assumes a more heroic tone, and
tells in truly thrilling verse the tale of Roncesvalles. But over and
above this double material, different in matter and in manner, we trace
throughout the whole romance a third element, which seems to be more
essentially the poet's own than either his fantastic tissue of
adventures or his serious narrative of Roland's death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">-442-</a></span> This third
element consists of half-ironical half-sober dissertations, reflective
digressions, and brilliant interpolated incidents, among which we have
to reckon the splendid episodes of Astarotte and Margutte. So much was
clear to my mind when I first read the <i>Morgante</i>, and attempted to
comprehend the difficulties it presented to critics like Ginguen&#233; and
Hallam. Since then the truth of this view has been substantiated by the
eminent Italian scholar, Pio Rajna, who has proved that the <i>Morgante</i>
is the <i>rifacimento</i> of two earlier popular poems, the first existing in
MS. in the Laurentian library, the second entitled <i>La Spagna</i>.<a name="FNanchor_530_531" id="FNanchor_530_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_531" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
Pulci availed himself freely of his popular models, at times repeating
the old stanzas with no alteration, but oftener rehandling them and
adding to their comic spirit, and interpolating passages of his own
invention. Since the two originals differed in character, his
<i>rifacimento</i> retained their divers peculiarities, notwithstanding those
master-touches which betray the same hand in both of its main sections.
But the most precious part of the poem remains Pulci's own. Nothing can
deprive him of Margutte and Astarotte; nor without his clever
transmutation of the old material would the bulk of the <i>Morgante
Maggiore</i> deserve more attention than many similar romances buried in
condign oblivion. Between the two parts we may notice a considerable
difference of literary merit. The second and shorter is by far the finer
in poetic quality, earnestness, and power of treatment. The first is
tedious to read. The second inthralls and carries us along.<a name="FNanchor_531_532" id="FNanchor_531_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_532" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">-443-</a></span></p><p>The poem takes its title from the comic hero Morgante, a giant captured
and converted by Orlando in the first Canto.<a name="FNanchor_532_533" id="FNanchor_532_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_533" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> He dies, however, in
the twentieth, and the narrative proceeds with no interruption. If we
seek for epical unity, in a romance so loosely put together from so many
divers sources, we can find it in the treason of Gano. The action turns
decisively and frequently upon this single point, returns to it from
time to time for fresh motives, and reaches its conclusion in the
execution of the traitor after the great deed of crime has been
accomplished in the valley dolorous. An Italian of the fifteenth century
could not have chosen a motive more suited to the temper and experience
of his age, when conspiracies like that of the Pazzi at Florence and the
Baglioni at Perugia were frightfully frequent, and when the successful
massacre of Sinigaglia made Cesare Borgia the hero of historical
romance. <i>Il tradimento</i>, <i>il traditore</i>, the kiss of Judas, the simile
of the fox, recur with fatal resonance through all the Cantos of the
poem. The style assumes a rugged grandeur of tragic realism, not
unworthy of poets of the stamp of our own Webster or Marston, in the
passage which describes the tempest by the well at Saragossa, where Gano
met Marsilio to plan their fraud, and where the locust-tree let fall its
fruit upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">-444-</a></span> the traitor's head.<a name="FNanchor_533_534" id="FNanchor_533_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_534" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> The <i>Morgante</i> is, in truth, the
epic of treason, and the character of Gano, as an accomplished yet not
utterly abandoned Judas, is admirably sustained throughout. The powerful
impression of his perversity is heightened by contrast with the loyalty
of his son Baldovino. In the fight at Roncesvalles Baldovino carries a
mantle given to Gano by the Saracen king, without knowing for what
purpose his father made him wear it; and wherever he charges through the
press of men, the foes avoid him. Orlando learns that he is protected by
this ensign of fraud, and accuses him of partaking in Gano's treason.
Then the youth flings the cloak from his shoulders, and plunges into the
fight with an indignant repudiation of this shame upon his lips. The
scene is not unworthy of the <i>Iliad</i>;<a name="FNanchor_534_535" id="FNanchor_534_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_535" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> and his last words, as he
falls <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">-445-</a></span>pierced in the breast with two lances, <i>Or non son io pi&#249;
traditiore!</i> are dramatic.</p>

<p>Pulci deserves credit for strong delineation of character. Through all
the apish tricks and fantastic arabesque-work of his style, the chief
personages retain firmly-marked types. Never since the <i>Chanson de
Roland</i> was first sung, has a more heroic portrait of Orlando, the
God-fearing knight, obedient to his liege-lord, serene in his courage
and gentle in his strength, courteous, pious and affectionate, been
painted.<a name="FNanchor_535_536" id="FNanchor_535_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_536" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> Close adherence to the popular conception of Orlando's
character here stood Pulci in good stead; nor was he hampered with the
difficulties which beset Boiardo and Ariosto, when they showed the
champion of Christianity subdued to madness and to love. Thus one work
at least of the Renaissance maintained for the Italians an ideal of
chivalrous heroism, first conceived by Franco-Norman bards, and
afterwards transmitted through the fancy of the people, who are ever
ready to discern and to preserve the lineaments of greatness. Oliver the
true friend and doughty warrior, Rinaldo the fiery foe and reckless
lover, to whom the press of men was Paradise,<a name="FNanchor_536_537" id="FNanchor_536_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_537" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> and Malagigi the
magician, are drawn with no less skill. Charles is such as the
traditions of the myth and the requirements of the plot <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">-446-</a></span>obliged Pulci
to make him. Yet in spite of the feebleness which exposes him to the
treasonable arts of Gano, he is not deficient in a certain nobility. In
the conduct of these characters, amid the windings of the poet's
freakish fancy, we trace the solidity of his plan, his faculty for
earnest art. But should there still be found critics who, after a
careful study of Gano, Orlando, Uliviero, Rinaldo and Carlo, think that
Pulci meant his poem for a mere burlesque, this opinion cannot but be
shaken by a perusal of the twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh
Cantos. The refusal of Orlando to blow his horn:</p>

impossible odds<a name="FNanchor_537_538" id="FNanchor_537_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_538" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>; the scene of his death, so tender in its pathos,
so quaint in its piety; the agony of Charles when he comes, too late, to
find him slain, and receives his sword from the Paladin's dead hands;
these passages must surely be enough to convince the most incredulous of
doctrinaires.</p>

<p>It has been customary to explain the apparent contradictions of the
<i>Morgante Maggiore</i>&#8212;Pulci's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">-447-</a></span> brusque transitions from piety to
ribaldry, from pathos to satire&#8212;by reference to the circumstances of
Florence at the date of its composition. The republic was at war with
Sixtus IV., who had taken part in the Pazzi conspiracy. To his Bull of
excommunication the Signoria had retorted by terming it &quot;maledictam
maledictionem damnatissimi judicis,&quot; and had described the Pope himself
as &quot;delirum senem,&quot; &quot;leno matris su&#230;, adulterorum minister, diaboli
vicarius.&quot; It was not to be expected that even an orthodox Christian
should be tender toward the vices of the clergy or careful in guarding
his religious utterances at such a moment. Yet we need not go far afield
to account for Pulci's profanity. The Italians of the age in which he
lived, were freethinkers without ceasing to be Catholics. To begin a
Canto with a prayer, and to end it with speculations on the destiny of
the soul after death, was consistent with their intellectual temper. The
schools and private coteries of Florence were the arena in which
Platonism and Averroism waged war with orthodoxy, where questions of
freewill and creation, the relation of man to God, and the essence of
the human spirit, were being discussed with a philosophic indifference
and warmth of curiosity that prepared the way for Pomponazzi's
materialism. Criticism, the modern Hercules, was already in its cradle,
strangling the serpents of sacerdotal authority: and as yet the
Inquisition had not become a power of terror; the Council of Trent and
the Spanish tyranny had not turned Italians into trembling bigots or
sleek hypocrites. Externally they remained tenacious of their old
beliefs; and from the point of view of art at least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">-448-</a></span> they were desirous
of adhering to tradition. For Pulci to have celebrated Orlando without
assuming the customary style of the <i>cantastorie</i>, would have been
beside his purpose. Therefore, the mixture of magic, theology, impiety,
speculation and religious fervor which perplexes a reader of the present
day in the <i>Morgante</i>, corresponded to the mental attitude of the
educated majority at Pulci's date. On the border-land between the middle
ages and the modern world the keen Italian intellect loved to entertain
itself with a perpetual <i>perhaps</i>, impartially including in the sphere
of doubt old dogmas and novel hypotheses, and finding satisfaction in an
insecurity that flattered it with the sense of disengagement from
formul&#230;.<a name="FNanchor_538_539" id="FNanchor_538_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_539" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> With some minds this volatile questioning was serious;
with others it assumed a Rabelaisian joviality. Pulci ranked with those
who made the problems of the world material for humorous debate.</p>

<p>A few instances of Pulci's peculiar levity might be selected from the
last Cantos of the <i>Morgante</i>, where no one can maintain that his
intention was burlesque. We have just heard from the minstrel's lips how
Roland died, recommending his soul to God and delivering his glove in
sign of feudal fealty to Gabriel. The sound of his horn has startled
Charlemagne from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">-449-</a></span> sleep of false tranquillity, and the Emperor is on
his way to Roncesvalles. But time is short. He prays Christ that as of
old for Joshua, so now for him in his sore need, the sun may be stayed
and the day be prolonged<a name="FNanchor_539_540" id="FNanchor_539_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_540" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>:</p>

<p>The prayer is worthy, in its solemn tone, of this exordium; and the

<p>Pulci's grotesque humor gives an air of false absurdity to many
incidents which, together with his hearers, he undoubtedly took in good

<p>Such expressions flash forth from mere Florentine sense of fun in
passages by no means deliberately comic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">-451-</a></span></p><p>The most diverting character of the <i>Morgante</i> is Margutte, an
eccentric heteroclite creature, the prototype of Folengo's Cingar and
Rabelais' Panurge, whom the giant met upon his wanderings and adopted
for a comrade. It has been supposed with some reason that Pulci here
intended to satirize the Greeks who flocked to Florence after the fall
of Constantinople, and that either Marullo, the personal enemy of
Poliziano, or Demetrius Chalcondylas, his rival in erudition, sat for
Margutte's portrait. The character of the rogue, described by himself in
thirty stanzas of fantastic humor, contains a complete epitome of the
abuse which the scholars of those days used to vomit forth in their
reciprocal invectives.<a name="FNanchor_545_546" id="FNanchor_545_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_546" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> Part of the comic effect produced by his
speech is due to this self-attribution of qualities which supplied the
arsenals of humanistic combatants with poisoned arrows. But Margutte has
far more than a merely illustrative or temporary value. He is the first
finished humoristic portrait sketched in modern literature, the first
broadly-conceived and jovially-executed Rabelaisian study. Though it is
very improbable that Pulci had any knowledge of Aristophanes, though he
died eight years or thereabouts before the Cur&#233; of Meudon was born, his
Margutte is cousin-german of the Sausage-seller and Panurge.<a name="FNanchor_546_547" id="FNanchor_546_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_547" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
Margutte takes an impish pride in reckoning up his villanies and vices.
When <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">-452-</a></span>Morgante asks him whether he believes in Christ or Appollino, he
replies:</p>

<p>Margutte's humor consists in the baboon-like self-contentment of his
infamous confessions, and in the effect they produce upon Morgante, who
feels that he has found in him a finished gentleman. After amusing his
audience with this puppet for a while, Pulci flings him aside. Margutte,
like Pietro Aretino, dies at last of immoderate laughter.<a name="FNanchor_547_548" id="FNanchor_547_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_548" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>Another of Pulci's own creations is Astarotte, the proud and courteous
fiend, summoned by Malagigi to bring Rinaldo from Egypt to Roncesvalles.
This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">-453-</a></span> feat he accomplishes in a few hours by entering the body of the
horse Baiardo. The journey consists of a series of splendid leaps,
across lakes, rivers, mountains, seas and cities; and when the paladin
hungers, Astarotte spreads a table for him in the wilderness or
introduces him invisible into the company of queens at banquet in fair
Saragossa. The humor and the fancy of this magic journey are both of a
high order.<a name="FNanchor_548_549" id="FNanchor_548_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_549" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Yet Astarotte is made to serve a second purpose. Into

<p>Pulci dealt with the Carolingian Cycle in what may be termed a
<i>bourgeois</i> spirit. Whether humorous or earnest, he maintained the tone
of Florentine society: and his <i>Morgante</i> reflects the peculiar
conditions of the Medicean circle at the date of its composition. The
second great poem on the same group of legends, Boiardo's <i>Orlando
Innamorato</i>, transports us into a very different social and intellectual
atmosphere. The highborn Count of Scandiano, reciting his cantos in the
huge square castle surrounded by its moat, which still survives to speak
of medieval Italy in the midst of Ferrara, had but little in common with
Luigi Pulci, whose Tuscan fun and satire amused the merchant-princes of
the Via Larga. The value of the <i>Orlando Innamorato</i> for the student of
Italian development is principally this, that it is the most purely
chivalrous poem of the Renaissance. Composed before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">-457-</a></span> French
invasion, and while the classical Revival was still unaccomplished, we
find in it an echo of an earlier semi-feudal civility. Unlike the other
literary performances of that age, which were produced for the most part
by professional humanists, it was the work of a nobleman to whom feats
of arms and the chase were familiar, who disdained the common folk
(<i>popolaccio</i>, <i>canaglia</i>, as he always calls them), and whose ideal
both of life and of art was contained in this couplet<a name="FNanchor_559_560" id="FNanchor_559_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_560" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>:</p>

<p>Matteo Maria Boiardo was almost an exact contemporary of Pulci. He was
born about 1434 at his hereditary fief of Scandiano, a village seven
miles from Reggio, at the foot of the Apennines, celebrated for its
excellent vineyards. His mother was Lucia Strozzi, a member of the
Ferrarese house, connected by descent with the Strozzi of Florence. At
the age of twenty-eight he married Taddea Gonzaga, daughter of the Count
of Novellara. He lived until 1494, when he died at the same time as Pico
and Poliziano, in the year of Charles VIII.'s invasion, two years after
the death of Lorenzo de' Medici, and four years before Ficino. These
dates are not unimportant as fixing the exact epoch of Boiardo's
literary activity. At the Court of Ferrara, where the Count of Scandiano
enjoyed the friendship of Duke Borso and Duke Ercole, this bard of
chivalry held a position worthy of his noble rank and his great talents.
The princes of the House of Este employed him as embassador in
diplomatic missions of high trust and honor. He also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">-458-</a></span> administered for
them the government of Reggio and Modena, their two chief subject
cities. As a ruler, he was celebrated for his clemency and for his
indifference to legal formalities. An enemy, Panciroli, wrote of him:
&quot;He was a man of excessive kindness, more fit for writing poems than for
punishing crimes.&quot; He is even reported to have held that no offense
deserved capital punishment&#8212;an opinion which at that period could only
have been seriously entertained in Italy, and which even there was
strangely at variance with the temper of the petty tyrants. Well versed
in Greek and Latin literature, he translated Herodotus, parts of
Xenophon, the <i>Golden Ass</i> of Apuleius, and the <i>Ass</i> of Lucian into
Italian. He also versified Lucian's <i>Timon</i> for the stage, and wrote
Latin poems of fair merit. His lyrics addressed to Antonia Caprara prove
that, like Lorenzo de' Medici, he was capable of following the path of
Petrarch without falling into Petrarchistic mannerism.<a name="FNanchor_560_561" id="FNanchor_560_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_561" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> But his
literary fame depends less upon these minor works than on the <i>Orlando
Innamorato</i>, a masterpiece of inventive genius, which furnished Ariosto
with the theme of the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>. Without the <i>Innamorato</i> the
<i>Furioso</i> is meaningless. The handling and structure of the romance, the
characters of the heroes and heroines, the conception of Love and Arms
as the double theme of romantic poetry, the interpolation of <i>novelle</i>
in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">-459-</a></span> manner of Boccaccio, and the magic machinery by which the poem
is conducted, are due to the originality of Boiardo. Ariosto adopted his
plot, continued the story where he left it, and brought it to a close;
so that, taken together, both poems form one gigantic narrative, of
about 100,000 lines, which has for its main subject the love and the
marriage of Ruggiero and Bradamante, mythical progenitors of the
Estensi. Yet because the style of Boiardo is rough and provincial, while
that of Ariosto is by all consent &quot;divine,&quot; Boiardo has been almost
forgotten by posterity.</p>

<p>Chivalry at no time took firm root in Italy, where the first act of the
Communes upon their achievement of independence had been to suppress
feudalism by forcing the nobles to reside as burghers within their
walls. The true centers of national vitality were the towns. Here the
Latin race assimilated to itself the Teutonic elements which might, if
left to flourish in the country, have given a different direction to
Italian development. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the
immense extension of mercantile activity, the formation of tyrannies,
the secular importance of the Papacy, and the absorption of the
cultivated classes in humanistic studies, removed the people ever
further from feudal traditions. Even the new system of warfare, whereby
the scions of noble families took pay from citizens and priests for the
conduct of military enterprises, tended to destroy the stronghold of
chivalrous feeling in a nation that grew to regard the profession of
arms as another branch of commerce. Still Italy could not wholly
separate herself from the rest of Europe, and there remained provinces
where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">-460-</a></span> kind of semi-feudalism flourished. The most important of these
undoubtedly was the kingdom of Naples, subject to alternate influence
from France and Spain, and governed by monarchs at frequent warfare with
their barons. The second was Ferrara, where the House of Este had
maintained unbroken lordship from the period when still the Empire was a
power in Italy. Here the ancient Lombard traditions of chivalry, the
customs of the Marca Amorosa, and the literature of the troubadours
still lingered.<a name="FNanchor_561_562" id="FNanchor_561_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_562" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> Externally at least, the manners of the Court were
feudal, however far removed its princes may have been in spirit from the
ideal of knighthood. In Ferrara, therefore, more than in Florence and
Venice, those cities of financiers and traders, could the romance of
chivalry be seriously treated by a poet who admired the knightly
virtues, and looked back upon the days of Arthur and of Roland as a
golden age of honor, far removed but real. While the humanists of
Florence indulged their fancy with dreams of Virgil's Saturnian reign,
the baron of Ferrara refashioned a visionary world from the wrecks of
old romance.<a name="FNanchor_562_563" id="FNanchor_562_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_563" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>Boiardo did not disdain to assume the style of a minstrel addressing his
courtly audience with compliments and <i>cong&#233;s</i> at the beginning and
ending of each canto. The first opens with these words:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
Signori e cavalieri che v'adunati<br />
Per odir cose dilettose e nuove,<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">-461-</a></span></p>

<p>But his spirit is always knightly, and he refrains from the quaint
pietism of Pulci's preambles. He is no mere jongleur or <i>Cantatore da
Banca</i>, but a new Sir Tristram, celebrating in heroic verse the valorous
deeds and amorous emotions of which he had himself partaken. Nor does
he, like Ariosto, appear before us as a courtier accomplished in the
arts of flattery, or as a man of letters anxious above all things to
refine his style. Neither the Court-life of Italy nor the humanism of
the revival had destroyed in him the spirit of old-world freedom and
noble courtesy. At the same time he was so far imbued with the culture
of the Renaissance as to appreciate the value of poetic unity and to
combine certain elements of classic learning with the material of
romance. Setting out with the aim of connecting all the Frankish legends
in one poem, he made Orlando his hero; but he perceived that the element
of love, which added so great a charm to the Arthurian Cycle, had
hitherto been neglected by the minstrels of Charlemagne. He therefore
resolved to tell a new tale of the mighty Roland; and the originality of
his poem consisted in the fact that he treated the material of the
<i>Chansons de Geste</i> in the spirit of the Breton legends.<a name="FNanchor_563_564" id="FNanchor_563_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_564" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> Turpin, he
asserts with a grave irony, had hidden away the secret of Orlando's
love; but he will unfold the truth, believing that no knight was ever
the less noble for his love. Accordingly the passion of Orlando for &quot;the
fairest of her sex, Angelica,&quot; like the wrath of Achilles in the
<i>Iliad</i>, is the mainspring of Boiardo's poem. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">-462-</a></span> his genius we owe the
creation of that fascinating princess of the East, as well as the
invention of the fountains of Cupid and Merlin, which cause the
alternate loves and hates of his heroes and heroines&#8212;the whole of that
closely-woven mesh of sentiment in which the adventures and the warlike
achievements of Paladins and Saracens alike are involved.</p>

<p>In dealing with his subject Boiardo is serious&#8212;as serious, that is to
say, as a writer of romance can be.<a name="FNanchor_564_565" id="FNanchor_564_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_565" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> His belief in chivalry itself
is earnest, though the presentation of knightly prowess runs into
intentional extravagance. A dash of Italian merriment mingles with his
enthusiasm; but he has none of Pulci's skeptical satiric humor, none of
Ariosto's all-pervasive irony. The second thoughts of the burlesque poet
or of the humorous philosopher do not cross the warp of his conception,
and his exaggerations are romantic. Such a poem as the <i>Orlando
Innamorato</i> could not have been planned or executed in Italy at any
other period or under any other circumstances. A few years after
Boiardo's death Italy was plunged into the wars that led to her
enslavement. Charles V. was born and Luther was beginning to shake
Germany. The forces of the Renaissance were in full operation,
destroying the faiths and fervors of the medieval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">-463-</a></span> world, closing the
old &#230;on with laughter and lamentation, raising new ideals as yet
imperfectly apprehended. Meanwhile Boiardo, whose life coincided with
the final period of Italian independence, uttered the last note of the
bygone age. His poem, chivalrous, free, joyous, with not one stain of
Ariosto's servility or of Tasso's melancholy, corresponded to a brief
and passing moment in the evolution of the national art. In the pure and
vivid beauty which distinguish it, the sunset of chivalry and the
sunrise of modern culture blend their colors, as in some far northern
twilight of midsummer night. Joyousness pervades its cantos and is
elemental to its inspiration&#8212;the joy of open nature, of sensual though
steadfast love, of strong limbs and eventful living, of restless
activity, of childlike security. Boiardo's style reminds us somewhat of
Benozzo Gozzoli in painting, or of Piero di Cosimo, who used the skill
of the Renaissance to express the cheerful <i>na&#239;vet&#233;</i> of a less
self-conscious time. It is sad to read the last stanza of the
<i>Innamorato</i>, cut short ere it was half completed by the entry of the
French into Italy, and to know that so free and freshly-tuned a &quot;native
wood-note wild&quot; would never sound again.<a name="FNanchor_565_566" id="FNanchor_565_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_566" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> When Ariosto repieced the
broken thread, the spirit of the times was changed. Servitude,
adulation, irony, and the meridian splendor of Renaissance art had
succeeded to independence, frankness, enthusiasm and the poetry of
natural enjoyment. Far more magnificent is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">-464-</a></span> Ariosto's Muse; but we lack
the spontaneity of the elder poet. And as the years advance, the change
is more apparent toward decay. The genius of Boiardo might be compared
to some high-born lad, bred in the country, pure-hearted, muscular,
brave, fair to look upon. That of Ariosto is studious and accomplished
with the smile of worldly sarcasm upon his lips. The elegances of Bembo
and the Petrarchisti remind one of a hectic scented fop, emasculate and
artificial. Aretino resembles his own <i>bardassonacci, paggi da taverna</i>,
flaunting meretricious charms with brazen impudence. Tasso in the
distance wears a hair shirt beneath his armor of parade; he is a
Jesuit's pupil, crossing himself when he awakes from love-dreams and
reveries of pleasure. It was probably the discord between Boiardo's
spirit and the prevailing temper of the sixteenth century, far more than
the roughness of his verse or the provinciality of his language, that
caused him to be so strangely and completely forgotten. In the Italy of
Machiavelli and the Borgias, of Michelangelo and Julius II., his aims,
enthusiasms and artistic ideals found alike no sympathy. To class him
with his own kind, we must go beyond the Alps and seek his brethren in
France or England.</p>

<p>Boiardo's merit as a constructive artist can best be measured by the
analysis of his plot. Crowded as the <i>Orlando Innamorato</i> is with
incidents and episodes, and inexhaustible as may be the luxuriance of
the poet's fancy, the unity of his romance is complete. From the moment
of Angelica's appearance in the first canto, the whole action depends
upon her movements. She withdraws the Paladins to Albracca, and forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">-465-</a></span>
Charlemagne to bear the brunt of Marsilio's invasion alone. She restores
Orlando to the French host before Montalbano. It is her ring which frees
the fated Ruggiero from Atlante's charms. The nations of the earth are
in motion. East, West, and South and North send forth their countless
hordes to combat; but these vast forces are controlled by one woman's
caprice, and events are so handled by the poet as to make the fate of
myriads waver in the balance of her passions. We might compare Boiardo's
romance to an immense web, in which a variety of scenes and figures are
depicted by the constant addition of new threads. None of the old
threads are wasted; not one is merely superfluous. If one is dropped for
a moment and lost to sight, it reappears again. The slightest incidents
lead to the gravest results. Narratives of widely different character
are so interwoven as to aid each other, introducing fresh agents,
combining these with those whom we have learned to know, but leaving the
grand outlines of the main design untouched.</p>

<p>The miscellaneous details which enliven a tale of chivalry, are grouped
round four chief centers&#8212;Paris, where the poem opens with the
tournament that introduces Angelica, and where, at the end of the second
book, all the actors are assembled for the supreme struggle between
Christendom and Islam; Albracca, where Angelica is besieged in the far
East; Biserta, where the hosts of pagan Agramante muster, and the hero
Ruggiero is brought upon the scene; Montalbano, where Charlemagne
sustains defeat at the hands of Agramante, Rodamonte, Marsilio, and
Ruggiero. In order to combine such distant places in one action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">-466-</a></span>
Boiardo was obliged to set geography and time at defiance. Between
Tartary and Circassia, France and Spain, Africa and Hungary, the knights
make marches and countermarches within the space of a few weeks or even
days. All arrive at the same dangerous gates and passes, the same
seductive lakes and gardens; for the magical machinery of the romance
was more important to the poet's scheme than cosmographical conditions.
His more than dramatic contempt for distance was indispensable in the
conduct of a romance which admitted of no pause in the succession of
attractive incidents, and was also pardonable in an age devoid of
accurate geography. His chief aim was to secure novelty, excitement,
variety, ideal unity.</p>

<p>Boiardo further showed his grasp of art by the emphatic presentation of
the chief personages, whose action determined the salient features of
his tale. It is impossible to forget Angelica after her first entrance
on the scene at Paris. In like manner Marfisa at Albracca, Rodamonte in
the council-chamber at Biserta, Ruggiero on the heights of Mount Carena,
Orlando entering the combat before Albracca, Mandricardo passing forth
unarmed and unattended to avenge his father's death, are brought so
vividly before our eyes, that the earliest impression of each character
remains with us in all their subsequent appearances. The inferior actors
are introduced with less preparation and diminished emphasis, because
they have to occupy subordinate positions, and to group themselves
around the heroes; and thus the whole vast poem is like a piece of
arras-work, where the strongest definition of form, and the most
striking colors, serve to throw into relief the principal figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">-467-</a></span> amid
a multitude of minor shapes. Not less skill is manifested in the
preservation of the types of character outlined in these first
descriptions. To vary the specific qualities of all those knights
engaged in the same pursuit of love and arms, was extremely difficult.
Yet Boiardo, sometimes working on the lines laid down by earlier
romancers, sometimes inventing wholly new conceptions (as in the case of
Rodamonte, Ruggiero, Marfisa, Brandiamante), may be said to have
succeeded in this master-stroke of art. The Homeric heroes are scarcely
less firmly and subtly differentiated than his champions of chivalry.</p>

<p>Orlando is the ideal of Christian knighthood, fearless, indifferent to
wealth, chaste, religious, respectful in his love, courteous toward
women, swift to wrath, but generous even in his rage, exerting his
strength only when the occasion is worthy of him.<a name="FNanchor_566_567" id="FNanchor_566_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_567" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> His one weakness
is the passion for Angelica. Twice he refuses for her sake to accompany
Dudone to the help of his liege-lord, and in the fight at Montalbano he
is careless of Christendom so long as he can win his lady.<a name="FNanchor_567_568" id="FNanchor_567_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_568" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Studying
Boiardo's delineation of love-lunacy in Orlando, we understand how
Ariosto was led by it to the conception of the <i>Furioso</i>. Rinaldo is
cast in a somewhat inferior mold. Lion-hearted, fierce, rebellious
against Charles, prone to love and hate excessively, he is the type of
the feudal baron, turbulent and troublesome to his suzerain. Astolfo,
slight, vain, garrulous, fond of finery and flirting, boastful, yet as
fearless as the leopards on his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">-468-</a></span>shield, and winning hearts by his
courtesy and grace, offers a spirited contrast to the massive vigor of
Rinaldo. It was a master-stroke of humor to have provided this fop of a
Paladin with the lance of Argalia, whereby his physical weakness is
supplemented and his bravery becomes a match for the muscles of the
doughtiest champions.<a name="FNanchor_568_569" id="FNanchor_568_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_569" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> Brandimarte presents another aspect of the
chivalrous ideal. Fidelity is his chief virtue&#8212;loyalty to his love,
Fiordelisa, and his hero, Orlando, combined with a delightful frankness
and the freshness of untainted youth. He is not wise, but boyish,
amorous, of a simple, trustful soul; a kind of Italian Sir Bors.
Ferraguto, on the contrary, is all fire and fury, as petulantly fierce
in love as in arms, so hot in his temerity that even at times he can
forget the laws of honor.<a name="FNanchor_569_570" id="FNanchor_569_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_570" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> Mandricardo's distinctive quality (beside
that of generous daring, displayed in his solitary and unarmed quest of
Orlando, and in the achievement of Hector's armor) is singular good
fortune. Ruggiero has for his special mark victorious beauty, blent with
a courtesy and loftiness of soul, that opens his heart to romantic love,
and renders him peerless among youthful warriors. Boiardo has spared no
pains to impress our imagination with the potency of his unrivaled
comeliness.<a name="FNanchor_570_571" id="FNanchor_570_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_571" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> He moves before our eyes like the angelic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">-469-</a></span>knight in
Mantegna's <i>Madonna of the Victory</i>, or like Giorgione's picture of the
fair-haired and mail-clad donzel, born to conquer by the might of
beauty. Agramante, the Eastern Emperor, whose council is composed of
thirty-two crowned heads, enhances by his arrogance of youth the
world-worn prudence of old Charlemagne. Marfisa, the Amazonian Indian
queen, who has the force of twenty knights, and is as cruel in her
courage as a famished tigress, sets off the gentler prowess of
Brandiamante, Rinaldo's heroic sister. Rodamonte is the blustering,
atheistic, insolent young Ajax, standing alone against armies, and
hurling defiance at heaven from the midst of a sinking navy.<a name="FNanchor_571_572" id="FNanchor_571_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_572" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
Agricane is distinguished as the knight who loves fighting for its own
sake, and disdains culture; Sacripante, as the gentle and fearless
suitor of Angelica; Gradasso, as the hyperbolical champion of the
Orient, inflamed with a romantic desire to gain Durlindana and Baiardo,
the enchanted sword and horse. Gano and Truffaldino, among these
paragons of honor, are notable traitors, the one brave when he chooses
to abandon craft, the other cowardly. Brunello is the Thersites of the
company, a perfect thief, misshapen, mischievous, consummate in his
guile.<a name="FNanchor_572_573" id="FNanchor_572_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_573" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> Malagise deals in magic, and has a swarm of demons at his
back for all exigences. Turpin's chivalry is tempered with a subtle
flavor of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">-470-</a></span>the priest, exposing him to Boiardo's mockery. Of Oliver and
Ogier we hear, accidentally perhaps, but little. Such are some of
Boiardo's personages. Not a few were given to him by the old romancers;
but these he has new-fashioned to his needs.<a name="FNanchor_573_574" id="FNanchor_573_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_574" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> Others he has molded
from his own imagination with such plastic force that they fall short in
no respect of the time-honored standard. It is no slight tribute to his
creative power that we recognize a real fraternity between these puppets
of his fancy and the mythic heroes with whom they are associated. As
Boiardo left the actors in his drama, so Ariosto took them up and with
but slight change treated them in his continuation of the tale.</p>

<p>Women, with the exception of Marfisa and Brandiamante, fare but ill at
Boiardo's hands. He seems to have conceived of female character as a
compound of fickleness, infidelity, malice, falsehood, and light love.
Angelica is little better than a seductive witch, who dotes on Rinaldo,
and yet contrives to make use of Orlando, luring him to do her purpose
by false promises.<a name="FNanchor_574_575" id="FNanchor_574_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_575" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> Falerina and Dragontina are sorceresses, apt for
all iniquity and guile. Morgana and Alcina display the capricious loves
and inhuman spites of fairies. Origille is a subtle traitress, beautiful
enough to deceive Orlando, but as poisonous as a serpent. Even the
ladies who are intended to be amiable, show <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">-471-</a></span>but a low standard of
morality.<a name="FNanchor_575_576" id="FNanchor_575_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_576" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> Leodilla, princess of the Far Isles, glories in adultery,
and hates Orlando for his constancy to Angelica in absence.<a name="FNanchor_576_577" id="FNanchor_576_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_577" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>
Fiordelisa is false in thought to Brandimarte, when she sees Rinaldo
sleeping in the twilight. The picture, however, of the slumbering
warrior and the watchful maiden is so fresh and true to Boiardo's genius
that it deserves quotation<a name="FNanchor_577_578" id="FNanchor_577_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_578" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>:</p>

<p>Love, as conceived by Boiardo, though a powerful and steadfast passion,
is not spiritual. The knights love like centaurs, and fight like bulls
for the privilege of paying suit to their ladies. Rinaldo and Orlando
meet in deadly duel for Angelica; Rodamonte and Ferraguto dispute
Doralice, though the latter does not care for her, and only asserts his
right to dwell in thought upon her charms. Orlando and Agricane break
their courteous discourse outside Albracca to fight till one of them is
killed, merely because the name of Angelica has intervened. For
Boiardo's descriptions of love returned, and crowned with full fruition,
the reader may be referred to two magnificent passages in the episodes
of Leodilla and Fiordelisa.<a name="FNanchor_578_579" id="FNanchor_578_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_579" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> Poetically noble in spite of their
indelicacy, these pictures of sensuous and natural enjoyment might be
paralleled with the grand frankness of Venetian painting. It is to be
regretted for Boiardo's credit as an artist in expression, that more
than a bare reference to them is here impossible.</p>

<p>Boiardo's conception of friendship or fraternity in arms is finer. The
delineation of affection generated by mutual courtesy under the most
trying conditions of intercourse, which binds together the old rivals
Iroldo and Prasildo, has something in it truly touching.<a name="FNanchor_579_580" id="FNanchor_579_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_580" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">-473-</a></span>The same
passion of comradeship finds noble expression in the stanzas uttered by
Orlando, when he recognizes Rinaldo's shield suspended by Aridano near
Morgana's Lake.<a name="FNanchor_580_581" id="FNanchor_580_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_581" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> It must be remembered that the cousins had recently

<p>Scarcely less beautiful is the feeling which binds Brandimarte to the

liberty.<a name="FNanchor_581_582" id="FNanchor_581_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_582" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> Boiardo devotes the exordium of the seventh Canto of the

Far more than health, far more than strength is worth,<br />
Nay more than pleasure, more than honor vain,<br />
Is friendship tried alike in dole and mirth:<br />

To joy, by interchange of grief and pain;<br />
And when doubts rise, with free and open heart<br />
Each calls his friend, who gladly bears a part.<br />

What profit is there in much pearls and gold,<br />
Or power, or proud estate, or royal reign?<br />
Lacking a friend, mere wealth is frosty cold:<br />
He who loves not, and is not loved again,<br />

Brave Brandimarte drives his flying ship<br />

<p>Next to bravery the poet's favorite virtue is courtesy. It is enough to
mention Orlando's gentle forbearance with Agricane at Albracca, their
evening conversation in the midst of a bloody duel, and the hero's
sorrow when he has wounded his opponent to the death.<a name="FNanchor_582_583" id="FNanchor_582_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_583" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Of the same
quality is the courteous behavior of Rinaldo and Gradasso before a
deadly encounter, the aid afforded to Marfisa by Rinaldo in the midst of
their duel, and the graceful sympathy of Astolfo for Brandimarte, whom

intelligence and love, are Orlando's discourse with Agricane and his
speech to Morgana's maiden. In the first of these the Count and King had
fought till nightfall. Then they agree to sleep together side by side,
and to resume the combat at daybreak. Before they settle for the night,
they talk<a name="FNanchor_584_585" id="FNanchor_584_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_585" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>:</p>

After the sun below the hills was laid,<br />
And with bright stars the sky began to glow,<br />
Unto the King these words Orlando said:<br />
&quot;What shall we do, now that the day is low?&quot;<br />
Then Agrican made answer, &quot;Make our bed<br />
Together here, amid the herbs that grow;<br />
And then to-morrow with the dawn of light<br />
We can return and recommence the fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
No sooner said, than straight they were agreed:<br />
Each tied his horse to trees that near them grew;<br />
Then down they lay upon the grassy mead&#8212;<br />
You might have thought they were old friends and true,<br />
So close and careless couched they in the reed.<br />
Orlando nigh unto the fountain drew,<br />
And Agrican hard by the forest laid<br />
His length beneath a mighty pine-tree's shade.<br />
<br />
Herewith the twain began to hold debate<br />
Of fitting things and meet for noble knights.<br />
The Count looked up to heaven and cried, &quot;How great<br />
And fair is yonder frame of glittering lights,<br />
Which God, the mighty monarch, did create;<br />
The silvery moon, and stars that gem our nights,<br />
The light of day, yea, and the lustrous sun,<br />
For us poor men God made them every one!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Agrican: &quot;Full well I apprehend<br />
It is your wish toward faith our talk to turn:<br />
Of science less than naught I comprehend;<br />
Nay, when I was a boy, I would not learn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">-476-</a></span><br />
But broke my master's head to make amend<br />
For his much prating; no one since did yearn<br />
To teach me book or writing, such the dread<br />
Wherewith I filled them for my hardihead.<br />
<br />
&quot;And so I let my boyish days flow by,<br />
In hunting, feats of arms, and horsemanship;<br />
Nor is it meet, meseems, for chivalry<br />
To pore the livelong day on scholarship.<br />
True knights should strive to prove their skill, say I,<br />
And strength of limb in noble fellowship;<br />
Leave priests and teaching men from books to learn.<br />
I know enough, thank God, to serve my turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then spake the Count: &quot;Thus far we both agree;<br />
Arms are the chief prime honor of a knight.<br />
Yet knowledge brings no shame that I can see,<br />
But rather fame, as fields with flowers are bright;<br />
More like an ox, a stock, a stone is he<br />
Who never thinks of God's eternal light;<br />
Nor without learning can we rightly dwell<br />
On his high majesty adorable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Agrican, &quot;Small courtesy it were,<br />
War with advantage so complete to wage!<br />
My nature I have laid before you bare;<br />
I know full well that you are learned and sage;<br />
Therefore to answer you I do not care.<br />
Sleep if you like; in sleep your soul assuage;<br />
Or if you choose with me to hold discourse,<br />
I look for talk of love, and deeds of force.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I beseech you, answer me the truth<br />
Of what I ask, upon a brave man's faith:<br />
Are you the great Orlando, in good sooth,<br />
Whose name and fame the whole world echoeth?<br />
Whence are you come, and why? And since your youth<br />
Were you by love inthralled? For story saith<br />
That any knight who loves not, though he seem<br />
To sight alive, yet lives but in a dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then spake the Count: &quot;Orlando sure am I<br />
Who both Almonte and his brother slew.<br />
Imperious love hath lost me utterly,<br />
And made me journey to strange lands and new;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">-477-</a></span><br />

<p>This unlucky mention of Angelica stirs the rage of Agricane, and the two
men fight in the moonlight beneath the forest-trees till the young King
is wounded to the death&#8212;a splendid subject for some imaginative
painter's pencil. We may notice in this dialogue the modification of
chivalry occasioned by Italian respect for culture. Boiardo exalts the
courage of the educated gentleman above the valor of a man-at-arms. In
the conversation between Orlando and Morgana's maiden he depicts another
aspect of the knightly ideal. The fairy has made Orlando offer of
inestimable treasures, but he answers that indifference to riches is the
sign of a noble heart<a name="FNanchor_585_586" id="FNanchor_585_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_586" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>:</p>

<p>Having seen the knights in their more generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">-478-</a></span> moments, we ought to
bear in mind that they are capable of blustering, boasting, and
exchanging foul abuse like humanists. One reference will suffice.
Orlando and Rinaldo quarrel at Albracca and defy each other to combat.
Before fighting they indulge in elaborate caricatures and vilifications,
from which it would appear, to say the least, that these champions of
Christendom were the subject of much scandalous gossip.<a name="FNanchor_586_587" id="FNanchor_586_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_587" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>Human nature, unsophisticated and unqualified, with the crude impulses
and the contradictions proper to an unreflective age, has been studied
by Boiardo for his men and women. His power of expressing the passions
by natural signs might win for him the title of the Homer of Chivalry.
The love lamentations of Prasildo, the love-languors of Angelica, the
frenzy of Marfisa, the wrath of Ferraguto, the truculency of Rodamonte,
the impish craft of Brunello, Origille's cunning, Brandimarte's fervor,
Ruggiero's impatience to try his strength in the tournament, and his
sudden ecstasy of love for Brandiamante&#8212;these and a hundred other
instances of vigorous dramatic presentation could be mentioned. In his
pictures of scenery and descriptions Boiardo follows nature no less
faithfully&#8212;and this, be it remembered, in an age which refined on
nature and admitted into art only certain chosen phases of her
loveliness. Of affectation and elaboration he has none. The freshness of
authentic vision gives peculiar vividness to the storm that overtakes
Rodamonte in mid-channel; to the garden of Falerina, where Orlando
stuffs his cask with roses in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">-479-</a></span> order to stop his ears against a Siren's
song; to the picture of Morgana combing Ziliante's hair in the midst of
her enchanted meadows, and to the scene in which Angelica greets Orlando
with a perfumed bath after the battle.<a name="FNanchor_587_588" id="FNanchor_587_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_588" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> The charm of Boiardo's
poetry consists in its firm grasp on truth and nature, the spontaneity
and immediateness of its painting. He has none of Poliziano's richness,
no Virgilian dignity or sweetness, no smooth and sparkling fluency like
that of Ariosto. But all that he writes has in it the perfume of the
soil, the freedom of the open air; the spirits of the woods and sea and
stars are in it. Of his style the most striking merit is rapidity.
Almost always unpolished, sometimes even coarse, but invariably spirited
and masculine, his verse leaps onward like a grayhound in its swiftness.
Story succeeds story with extraordinary speed; and whether of love or
arms, they are equally well told. The pathetic novel of Tisbina,
Rinaldo's wondrous combat with the griffins and the giants, the
lion-hunt at Biserta, the mustering of Agramante's lieges, and the flux
and reflux of battle before Montalbano tax the vivid and elastic vigor
of Boiardo in five distinct species of rapid narration; and in all of
them he proves himself more than adequate to the strain. For ornaments
he cared but little, nor did he wait to elaborate similes. A lion at
bay, a furious bull, a river foaming to the sea, a swollen torrent, two
battling winds, a storm of hail, the clash of thunderclouds, an
earthquake, are the figures he is apt to use. The descriptions of
Rinaldo, Marfisa and Orlando, may be cited as favor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">-480-</a></span>able specimens of
his illustrative metaphors.<a name="FNanchor_588_589" id="FNanchor_588_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_589" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Short phrases like <i>a guisa di leone</i>,
<i>a guisa di colomba</i>, <i>a guisa di serpente</i>, <i>a guisa d'uno drago</i>, <i>a
guisa di castello</i>, indicate in outline images that aid the poet's
thought. But nothing like the polish or minuteness of Ariosto's
highly-wrought comparisons can be found in the <i>Innamorato</i>. Boiardo's
study of the classics had not roused him to the emulation of their
decorative beauties. Nor, again, did he attend to cadence in his
versification. He would have wondered at the <i>lim&#230; labor</i> of the poets
who came after him. His own stanzas are forcible, swift, fiery, never
pompous or voluptuous, liquid or sonorous. The changes wrought by
Poliziano in the structure of <i>ottava rima</i>, his majesty and &quot;linked
sweetness long drawn out,&quot; were unknown to Boiardo. Yet those rugged
octaves, in spite of their halting pauses at the end of the fifth line,
in spite of their frequent repetitions and inequalities of volume, are
better adapted to the spirit of his medieval subject-matter than the
sumptuous splendor of more polished versifiers. His diction, in like
manner, judged by the standard of the <i>cinque cento</i>, is far from
choice&#8212;loaded with Lombardisms, gaining energy and vividness at the
expense of refinement and precision. Thus style and spirit alike removed
him from the sympathies of the correct and classic age that followed.</p>

<p>For the student of the earlier Renaissance Boiardo's art has one
commanding point of interest. In the romantic treatment of antique
motives he is unique. It was the aim of Italian poets after Boccaccio to
effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">-481-</a></span> a fusion between the classical and modern styles, and to ingraft
the beauties of antique literature upon their own language. Boiardo, far
more a child of nature than either Boccaccio or Poliziano, with deeper
sympathy for feudal traditions and chivalrous modes of feeling, attacked
this problem from a point of view directly opposite to theirs. His
comprehensive study of Greek and Roman authors had stored his mind with
legends which gave an impulse to the freedom of his own imagination. He
did not imitate the ancients; but used the myths with so much novelty
and delicate perception of their charm, that beneath his touch they
assumed a fresh and fascinating quality. There is nothing grotesque in
his presentation of Hellenic fancy, nothing corresponding to the
medieval transformation of deities into devils; and yet his spirit is
not classical. His Sphinx, his Cyclops, and his Circe-Dragontina, his
Medusa, his Pegasus, his Centaur, his Atalanta, his Satyr, are living
creatures of romantic wonderland, with just enough of classic
gracefulness to remove them from the murky atmosphere of medieval
superstition into the serene ether of a neo-pagan mythology. Nothing can
be more dissimilar from Ovid, more unlike the forms of Gr&#230;co-Roman
sculpture. With his firm grasp upon reality, Boiardo succeeded in
naturalizing these classic fancies. They are not copied, but drawn from
the life of the poet's imagination. A good instance of this creative
faculty is the description of the Faun, who haunts the woodland in the
shade of leaves, and lives on fruits and drinks the stream, and weeps
when the sky is fair, because he then fears bad weather, but laughs when
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">-482-</a></span> rains, because he knows the sun will shine again.<a name="FNanchor_589_590" id="FNanchor_589_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_590" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> It is not
easy to find an exact analogue in the sister arts to this poetry, though
some points in the work of Botticelli and Piero di Cosimo, some early
engravings by Robeta and the Master of the Caduceus, some bass-reliefs
of Amadeo or incrustations on the chapel-walls of S. Francesco at
Rimini, a Circe by Dosso Dossi in the Borghese palace at Rome, an
etching of Mantegna here or there, might be quoted in illustration of
its spirit.<a name="FNanchor_590_591" id="FNanchor_590_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_591" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Better justice can be done to Boiardo's achievement by
citation than by critical description. The following stanzas are a
picture of Love attended by the Graces, punishing Rinaldo for his
rudeness near the Font of Merlin<a name="FNanchor_591_592" id="FNanchor_591_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_592" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>:</p>

When to the leafy wood his feet were brought,<br />
Towards Merlin's Font at once he took his way;<br />
Unto the font that changes amorous thought<br />
Journeyed the Paladin without delay;<br />
But a new sight, the which he had not sought,<br />
Caused him upon the path his feet to stay.<br />
Within the wood there is a little close<br />
Full of pink flowers, and white, and various:<br />
<br />
And in the midst thereof a naked boy,<br />
Singing, took solace with surpassing cheer;<br />
Three ladies round him, as around their joy,<br />
Danced naked in the light so soft and clear.<br />
No sword, no shield, hath been his wonted toy;<br />
Brown are his eyes; yellow his curls appear;<br />
His downy beard hath scarce begun to grow:<br />
One saith 'tis there, and one might answer, No!<br />
<br />
With violets, roses, flowers of every dye,<br />
Baskets they filled and eke their beauteous hands:<br />
Then as they dance in joy and amity,<br />
The Lord of Montalbano near them stands:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">-483-</a></span><br />
Whereat, &quot;Behold the traitor!&quot; loud they cry,<br />
Soon as they mark the foe within their bands;<br />
&quot;Behold the thief, the scorner of delight,<br />
Caught in the trap at last in sorry plight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then with their baskets all with one consent<br />
Upon Rinaldo like a tempest bore:<br />
One flings red roses, one with violets blent<br />
Showers lilies, hyacinths, fast as she can pour:<br />
Each flower in falling with strange pain hath rent<br />
His heart and pricked his marrow to the core,<br />
Lighting a flame in every smitten part,<br />
As though the flowers concealed a fiery dart.<br />
<br />
The boy who, naked, coursed along the sod,<br />
Emptied his basket first, and then began,<br />
Wielding a long-grown leafy lily rod,<br />
To scourge the helmet of the tortured man:<br />
No aid Rinaldo found against the god,<br />
But fell to earth as helpless children can;<br />
The youth who saw him fallen, by the feet<br />
Seized him, and dragged him through the meadow sweet.<br />
<br />
And those three dames had each a garland rare<br />
Of roses; one was red and one was white:<br />
These from their snowy brows and foreheads fair<br />
They tore in haste, to beat the writhing knight:<br />
In vain he cried and raised his hands in prayer;<br />
For still they struck till they were tired quite:<br />
And round about him on the sward they went,<br />
Nor ceased from striking till the morn was spent.<br />
<br />
Nor massy cuirass, nor stout plate of steel,<br />
Could yield defense against those bitter blows:<br />
His flesh was swollen with many a livid weal<br />
Beneath his mail, and with such fiery woes<br />
Inflamed as spirits damned in hell may feel;<br />
Yet theirs, upon my troth, are fainter throes:<br />
Wherefore that Baron, sore, and scant of breath,<br />
For pain and fear was well-nigh brought to death.<br />
<br />
Nor whether they were gods or men he knew;<br />
Nor prayer, nor courage, nor defense availed,<br />
Till suddenly upon their shoulders grew<br />
And budded wings with gleaming gold engrailed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">-484-</a></span><br />
Radiant with crimson, white, and azure blue;<br />
And with a living-eye each plume was tailed,<br />
Not like a peacock's or a bird's, but bright<br />
And tender as a girl's with love's delight.<br />
<br />
Then after small delay their flight they took,<br />
And one by one soared upward to the sky,<br />
Leaving Rinaldo sole beside the brook.<br />
Full bitterly that Baron 'gan to cry,<br />
For grief and dole so great his bosom shook<br />
That still it seemed that he must surely die;<br />
And in the end so fiercely raged his pain<br />
That like a corpse he fell along the plain.

<p>This is a fine painting in the style I have attempted to
characterize&#8212;the imagery of the Greek mythology taking a new and
natural form of fanciful romance. It is alien to anything in antique
poetry or sculpture. Yet the poet's imagination had been touched to
finest issues by the spirit of the Greeks before he wrote it. Incapable
of transplanting the flowers of antiquity like delicate exotics into the
conservatory of studied art, he acclimatized them to the air of thought
and feeling in which his own romantic spirit breathed. This
distinguishes him from Poliziano, whose stately poem, like the
palm-house in Kew Gardens, contains specimens of all the fairest species
gathered from the art of Greece and Rome. Even more exquisitely instinct
with the first April freshness of Renaissance feeling is another
episode, where Boiardo presents the old tale of Narcissus under a wholly
new and original aspect. By what strange freak of fancy has he converted
Echo into an Empress of the East and added the pathos of the fairy
Silvanella, whose petulance amid her hopeless love throws magic on the
well! We are far away indeed from the Pompeian frescoes here<a name="FNanchor_592_593" id="FNanchor_592_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_593" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">-485-</a></span></p>

Beyond the bridge there was a little close<br />
All round the marble of that fountain fair;<br />
And in the midst a sepulcher arose,<br />
Not made by mortal art, however rare:<br />
Above in golden letters ran the gloss,<br />
Which said, &quot;That soul is vain beyond compare<br />
That falls a-doting on his own sweet eyes.<br />
Here in the tomb the boy Narcissus lies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erewhile Narcissus was a damozel<br />
So graceful, and of beauty so complete,<br />
That no fair painted form adorable<br />
Might with his perfect loveliness compete;<br />
Yet not less fair than proud, as poets tell,<br />
Seeing that arrogance and beauty meet<br />
Most times, and thus full well with mickle woe<br />
The laity of love is taught to know.<br />
<br />
So that the Empress of the Orient<br />
Doting upon Narcissus beyond measure,<br />
And finding him on love so little bent,<br />
So cruel and so careless of all pleasure,<br />
Poor wretch, her dolorous days in weeping spent,<br />
Craving from morn till eve of love the treasure,<br />
Praying vain prayers of power from Heaven to turn<br />
The very sun, and make him cease to burn.<br />
<br />
Yet all these words she cast upon the wind;<br />
For he, heart-hardened, would not hear her moan,<br />
More than the asp, both deaf to charms and blind.<br />
Wherefore by slow degrees more feeble grown,<br />
Toward death she daily dwindling sank and pined;<br />
But ere she died, to Love she cried alone,<br />
Pouring sad sighs forth with her latest breath,<br />
For vengeance for her undeserv&#233;d death.<br />
<br />
And this Love granted: for beside the stream<br />
Of which I spoke, Narcissus happed to stray<br />
While hunting, and perceived its silvery gleam;<br />
Then having chased the deer a weary way,<br />
He leaned to drink, and saw as though in dream,<br />
His face, ne'er seen by him until that day;<br />
And as he gazed, such madness round him floated,<br />
That with fond love on his fair self he doted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">-486-</a></span><br />
<br />
Whoever heard so strange a story told?<br />
Justice of Love! how true, how strong it is!<br />
Now he stands sighing by the fountain cold<br />
For what he hath, yet never can be his!<br />
He that was erst so hard as stone of old,<br />
Whom ladies like a god on bended knees<br />
Devoutly wooed, imploring him for grace,<br />
Now dies of vain desire for his own face.<br />
<br />
Poring upon his perfect countenance,<br />
Which on this earth hath ne'er a paragon,<br />
He pined in deep desire's extravagance,<br />
Little by little, like a lily blown,<br />
Or like a cropped rose; till, poor boy, the glance,<br />
Of his black eyes, his cheek's vermilion,<br />
His snowy whiteness, and his gleeful mirth<br />
Death froze who freezes all things upon earth.<br />
<br />
Then by sad misadventure through the glade<br />
The fairy Silvanella took her way;<br />
And on the spot where now this tomb is made,<br />
Mid flowers the dead youth very beauteous lay:<br />
She, marveling at his fair face, wept and stayed<br />
In sore discomfiture and cold dismay;<br />
Nor could she quit the place, but slowly came<br />
To pine and waste for him with amorous flame.<br />
<br />
Yea, though the boy was dead, for him she burned:<br />
Pity and grief her gentle soul o'erspread:<br />
Beside him on the grass she lay and mourned,<br />
Kissing his clay-cold lips and mouth and head.<br />
But at the last her madness she discerned,<br />
To love a corpse wherefrom the soul had fled:<br />
Yet knows she not, poor wretch, her doom to shun;<br />
She fain would love not, yet she must love on.<br />
<br />
When all the night and all the following day<br />
Were wasted in the torrent of her woes,<br />
A comely tomb of marble fair the Fay<br />
Built by enchantment in the flowery close;<br />
Nor ever from that station would she stray,<br />
But wept and mourned; till worn by weary throes,<br />
Beside the font within a little space<br />
Like snow before the sun she pined apace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">-487-</a></span><br />
<br />
Yet for relief, or that she might not rue<br />
Alone the luckless doom which made her die,<br />
E'en mid the pangs of love such charms she threw<br />
Upon the font in her malignity,<br />
That all who passing toward the water drew<br />
And gazed thereon, perchance with listless eye,<br />
Must in the depth see maiden faces fair,<br />
Graceful and soul-inthralling mirrored there.<br />
<br />
They in their brows have beauty so entire<br />
That he who gazes cannot turn to fly,<br />
But in the end must fade of mere desire,<br />
And in that field lay himself down to die.<br />
Now it so chanced that by misfortune dire<br />
A king, wise, gentle, ardent, passed thereby,<br />
Together with his true and loving dame;<br />
Larbin and Calidora, such their name.

<p>In these stanzas the old vain passion of Narcissus for his own beauty
lives again a new life of romantic poetry. That the enchantment of the
boy's fascination, prolonged through Silvanella's mourning for his
death, should linger for ever after in the font that was his tomb, is a
peculiarly modern touch of mysterious fancy. This part of the romance
has little in common with the classic tale of Salmacis; it is far more
fragile and refined. The Greeks did not carry their human sympathy with
nature, deep and loyal as indeed it was, so far into the border-land of
sensual and spiritual things. Haunted hills, like the Venusberg of
Tannh&#228;user's legend; haunted waters, like Morgana's lake in Boiardo's
poem; the charmed rivers and fountains of naiads, where knights lose
their memory and are inclosed in crystal prison-caves; these are
essentially modern, the final flower and blossom of the medieval fancy,
unfolding stores of old mythology and half-for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">-488-</a></span>gotten emblems to the
light of day in art.<a name="FNanchor_593_594" id="FNanchor_593_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_594" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> For their perfection it was needful that the
gods of Hellas should have died, and that the phantoms of old-world
divinities should linger in dreams and reveries about the shores of
young romance.</p>

<p>Boiardo's treatment of magic is complementary to his use of classical
mythology. He does not employ this important element of medieval art in
its simplicity, but adapts it to the nature of his own imagination,
adding, as it were, a new quality by the process of assimilation. Some
of his machinery belongs, indeed, to the poems of his predecessors, or
is framed in harmony with their spirit. The enchantment of Durlindana
and Baiardo; the invulnerability of Orlando, Ferraguto, and other
heroes; the wizardry of Malagise, Mambrino's helmet, Morgana's stag, the
horse Rabicano, Argalia's lance, Angelica's ring, and the countless
dragons and giants which Boiardo creates at pleasure, may be mentioned
in this category. But it is otherwise with the gardens of Falerina and
Dragontina, the sublacustrine domain of Fata Morgana, and the caverns of
the Naiades. These, however much they may have once belonged to medieval
tradition, have been alchemized by the imagination of the poet of the
Renaissance. They are glimpses into ideal fairyland, which Ariosto and
Tasso could but refine upon and vary in their famous gardens of Alcina
and Armida. Boiardo's use of the old tradition of Merlin's fountain, and
the other well of Cupid feigned by him beside it, might again be chosen
to illustrate his free poetic treatment of magical motives. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">-489-</a></span> he
trespasses on these enchanted regions, then and then only does he
approach allegory. The quest of the tree guarded by Medusa in Tisbina's
story; the achievement by Orlando of Morgana's garden, where Penitence
and Fortune play their parts; and Rinaldo's encounter with Cupid in the
forest of Ardennes, have obviously allegorical elements. Yet the hidden
meaning is in each case less important than the adventure; and the same
may be said about the highly tragic symbolism of the monster in the
Rocca Crudele.<a name="FNanchor_594_595" id="FNanchor_594_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_595" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> Boiardo had too vivid a sympathy with nature and
humanity to appreciate the mysteries which allured the Northern poets of
<i>Parzival</i>, the <i>Sangraal</i>, and the <i>Faery Queen</i>. When he lapses into
allegory, it is with him a sign of weakness. Akin, perhaps, to this
disregard for parable is the freedom of his spirit from all
superstition. The religion of his knights is bluff, simple, and sincere,
in no sense savoring of the cloister and the cowl. A high sense of truth
and personal honor, indifference to life for life's sake, profound
humility in danger, charity impelling men of power to succor the
oppressed and feeble, are the fruits of their piety. But of penance for
sins of the flesh, of ceremonial observances, of visions and fasts, of
ascetic discipline and wonder-working images, of all the ecclesiastical
trumpery with which the pseudo-Turpin is filled, and which contaminates
even the <i>Mort d'Arthur</i> of our heroic Mallory, we read nothing.</p>

<p>In taking up the thread of Boiardo's narrative, Ariosto made use of all
his predecessor had invented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">-490-</a></span>. He adopted the machinery of the two
fountains, the lance of Argalia, Angelica's ring, Rabicane, and the
magic arts of Atalante. The characters of the <i>Innamorato</i> reappear with
slight but subtle changes and with somewhat softened names in the
<i>Furioso</i>.<a name="FNanchor_595_596" id="FNanchor_595_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_596" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> Ariosto, again, followed Boiardo closely in his peculiar
method of interweaving <i>novelle</i> with the main narrative; of suspending
one story to resume another at a critical moment; of prefacing his
cantos with reflections, and of concluding them with a courteous
license.<a name="FNanchor_596_597" id="FNanchor_596_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_597" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> Lastly, Ariosto is at great pains, while connecting his
poem with the <i>Innamorato</i>, to make it intelligible by giving short
abstracts at intervals of the previous action. Yet throughout this long
laborious work of continuation he preserves a studied silence respecting
the poet to whom he owed so much. Was this due to the desire of burying
Boiardo's fame beneath his own? Did he so contrive that the contemporary
repute of the <i>Innamorato</i> should serve to float his <i>Furioso</i> and then
be forgotten by posterity? If so, he calculated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">-491-</a></span>wisely; for this is
what almost immediately happened. Though the <i>Orlando Innamorato</i> was
printed four times before 1513&#8212;once at Venice in 1486, once at
Scandiano in 1495, and again at Venice in 1506, 1511, and 1513&#8212;and
though it continued to be reprinted at Venice through the first half of
the sixteenth century, yet the sudden silence of the press after this
period shows that the <i>Furioso</i> had eclipsed Boiardo's fame. Still the
integral connection between the two poems could not be overlooked; and
just about the period of Ariosto's death, Francesco Berni conceived the
notion of rewriting Boiardo's epic with the expressed intention of
correcting its diction and rendering it more equal in style to the
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>. This <i>rifacimento</i> was published in 1541, after his
death. The mysterious circumstances that attended its publication, and
the nature of the changes introduced by Berni into the substance of
Boiardo's poem, will be touched upon when we arrive at this illustrious
writer of burlesque verse. It is enough to mention here that Berni's
version was printed twice between 1541 and 1545, and that then, like the
original, it fell into comparative oblivion till the end of the last
century. Meanwhile the second <i>rifacimento</i> by Domenichi appeared in
1545; and though this new issue was a mere piece of impudent
book-making, it superseded Berni's masterpiece during the next two
hundred years. The critics of the last century rediscovered Berni's
<i>rifacimento</i>, and began to quote Boiardo's poem under his name,
treating the real author as an ignorant and uncouth writer of a
barbarous dialect. Thus one of the most original poets of the fifteenth
century, to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">-492-</a></span> Italy owes the form and substance of the <i>Furioso</i>,
has been thrust aside and covered with contempt, by a curious irony of
fortune, owing to the very qualities that ought to have insured his
immortality. Used by Ariosto as the ladder for ascending to Parnassus;
by Berni as an exercising ground for the display of style; by Domenichi
as the means of getting his name widely known, the <i>Orlando Innamorato</i>
served any purposes but that of its great author's fame. Panizzi, by
reprinting the original poem along with the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, restored
Boiardo at length to his right place in Italian literature. From that
time forward it has been impossible to overlook his merits or to
underestimate Ariosto's obligations to so gifted and original a master.</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Ariosto&#8217;s</span> family was ancient and of honorable station in the Duchy of
Ferrara. His father, Nicol&#242;, held offices of trust under Ercole I., and
in the year 1472 was made Governor of Reggio, where he acquired property
and married. His wife, Daria Maleguzzi, gave birth at Reggio in 1474 to
their first-born, Lodovico, the poet. At Reggio the boy spent seven
years of childhood, removing with his father in 1481 to Rovigo. His
education appears to have been carried on at Ferrara, where he learned
Latin but no Greek. This ignorance of Greek literature placed him, like
Machiavelli, somewhat at a disadvantage among men of culture in an age
that set great store upon the knowledge of both ancient languages. He
was destined for a legal career; but, like Petrarch and Boccaccio, after
spending some useless years in unconge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">-494-</a></span>nial studies, Ariosto prevailed
upon his father to allow him to follow his strong bent for literature.
In 1500 Nicol&#242; Ariosto died, leaving a family of five sons and five
daughters, with property sufficient for the honor of his house but
scarcely adequate to the needs of his numerous children. Lodovico was
the eldest. He therefore found himself at the age of twenty-six in the
position of father to nine brothers and sisters, for whose education,
start in life, and suitable settlement, he was called on to arrange. The
administration of his father's estate, and the cares thus early thrust
upon him, made the poet an exact man of business, and brought him
acquainted with real life under its most serious aspects. He discharged
his duties with prudence and fidelity; managing by economy to provide
portions for his sisters and honorable maintenance for his brothers out
of their joint patrimony.</p>

<p>The first three years after his father's death were spent by Ariosto in
the neighborhood of Reggio, and to this period of his life we may
perhaps refer some of the love-affairs celebrated in his Latin poems. He
held the Captaincy of Canossa, a small sinecure involving no important
duties, since the Castle of Canossa was even in those days a ruin. In
1503 he entered the service of Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, with whom he
remained until 1517. He was placed upon the list of the Cardinal's
extraordinary servants, to be employed in matters of confidence and
delicacy, involving frequent journeys to all parts of Italy and
ceremonial embassies. His pay seems to have been fixed at 240 <i>lire
marchesane</i>, corresponding to about 1200 francs, charged upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">-495-</a></span> the
Archiepiscopal Chancery of Milan.<a name="FNanchor_597_598" id="FNanchor_597_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_598" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> This salary, had it been
regularly paid, would have suffered to maintain the poet in decent
comfort; but he had considerable difficulty from time to time in
realizing the sums due to him. Ippolito urged him to take orders, no
doubt with a view of securing better emoluments from benefices that
could only be conferred upon a member of the priesthood. But Ariosto
refused to enter a state of life for which he felt no vocation.<a name="FNanchor_598_599" id="FNanchor_598_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_599" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> The
Cardinal Deacon of S. Lucia in Silice was one of those secular princes
of the Church, addicted to worldly pleasures, profuse in personal
expenditure, with more inclination for the camp and the hunting-field
than for the duties of his station, who since the days of Sixtus IV. had
played a prominent part in the society of the Italian Courts. He was of
distinguished beauty; and his military courage, like that of the
Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici, was displayed in the Hungarian campaign
against the Turks. With regard to his character and temper, it may
suffice to remind the reader how, in a fit of jealous passion, he hired
assassins to put out his natural brother Giulio's eyes. That Ippolito
d'Este did not share the prevailing enthusiasm of his age for literary
culture, seems pretty clear; and he failed to discern the unique genius
of the man whom he had chosen for his confidential agent. Ariosto
complains that he was turned into a common courier and forced to spend
his days and nights upon the road by the master upon whom, at the
expense of truth and reason, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">-496-</a></span>he conferred an immortality of fame in his
great poem. Yet it would not be fair to echo the commonplace invectives
against the Cardinal for illiberality and ingratitude. Ariosto knew the
nature of his patron when he entered his service, and Ippolito did not
hire a student but an active man of business for his work. It was an
arrangement of convenience on both sides, to which the poet would never
have stooped had his private means sufficed, or had the conditions of
Italian society offered any decent career for a gentleman outside the
circle of the Court. Moreover, it was not until after their final
rupture, caused by Ariosto's refusal to undertake the Hungarian
expedition in his master's train, that the true greatness of the author
of the <i>Furioso</i> was revealed. How should a dissolute and
ill-conditioned Cardinal have discerned that a dreamy poem in MS. on the
madness of Orlando would live as long as the <i>&#198;neid</i>, or that the
flattering lies invented by his courier would in after ages turn the
fierce glare of criticism and celebrity upon the darkest corners of his
own history? The old legend about his brutal reception of the <i>Orlando
Furioso</i> has been now in part disproved.<a name="FNanchor_599_600" id="FNanchor_599_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_600" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> We know that he defrayed
the expenses of its publication, and secured the right and profits of
its sale to Ariosto.<a name="FNanchor_600_601" id="FNanchor_600_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_601" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> There is even an entry in his memoranda of
expenditure proving that he bought a copy for the sum of one <i>lira
marchesana</i>.<a name="FNanchor_601_602" id="FNanchor_601_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_602" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> While deploring the waste of Ariosto's time and
strength in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">-497-</a></span>uncongenial service of this patron, we must acknowledge
that his choice of Ippolito was a mistake for which he alone was
responsible, and that the panegyrics showered on such a man are wholly
inexcusable.<a name="FNanchor_602_603" id="FNanchor_602_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_603" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> When all the circumstances of their connection are
taken into account, there is nothing but the extreme irritation caused
by incompatibility of temper, and divergence of aims and interests, to
condone the poet's private censure of the master whom publicly he loaded
with praises.<a name="FNanchor_603_604" id="FNanchor_603_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_604" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> The whole unhappy story illustrates the real
conditions of that Court-life, so glowingly described by Castiglione,
which proved the ruin of Tasso and the disgrace of Guarini. Could
anything justify the brigandlike brutalities of Pietro Aretino, <i>il
flagello de' Principi</i>, we might base his apology upon the dreary
histories of these Italian poets, soured, impoverished, and broken
because they had been forced to put their trust in princes. When there
lay no choice between levying blackmail by menaces and coaxing crumbs by
flatteries, it accorded better with the Italian ideal <i>virt&#249;</i> to fatten
upon the former kind of infamy than to starve upon the latter.</p>

<p>The <i>Orlando Furioso</i> was conceived and begun in the year 1505. It was
sent to press in 1515. Giovanni Mazzocchi del Bondeno published it in
April, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">-498-</a></span>1516. A large portion of the poet's life was subsequently spent
in correcting and improving it. In 1518, having freed himself from
Ippolito's bondage, Ariosto entered the service of Duke Alfonso I. He
was termed <i>cameriere</i> or <i>famigliare</i>, and his stipend was fixed at
eighty-four golden crowns per annum, with maintenance for three servants
and two horses, paid in kind.<a name="FNanchor_604_605" id="FNanchor_604_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_605" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> He occupied his own house in Ferrara;
and the Duke, who recognized his great literary qualities and
appreciated the new luster conferred upon his family by the publication
of the <i>Furioso</i>, left him in the undisturbed possession of his
leisure.<a name="FNanchor_605_606" id="FNanchor_605_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_606" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> The next four years were probably the happiest of
Ariosto's life; for he had now at last secured independence and had
entered upon the enjoyment of his fame. The Medici of Florence and Rome,
and the ducal families of Urbino and Mantua, were pleased to number him
among their intimate friends, and he received flattering acknowledgments
of his poem from the most illustrious men of Italy. The few journeys he
made at the request of Alfonso carried him to Florence, the
head-quarters of literary and artistic activity. At home the time he
spared from the revision of the <i>Furioso</i>, was partly devoted to the
love-affairs he carried on with jealous secrecy, and partly to the
superintendence of the ducal theater. The criticism of Ariosto's
comedies must be reserved for another chapter. It is enough to remark
here that their composition amused him from his boyhood to his latest
years. So early as 1493 he had accompanied Ercole I. to Pavia in order
to play before Lodovico Sforza, and in the same year he witnessed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">-499-</a></span>the
famous representation of the <i>Men&#230;chmi</i> at Ferrara. Some of his earliest
essays in literature were translations of Latin comedies, now
unfortunately lost. They were intended for representation; and, as
exercises in the playwright's art, they strongly influenced his style.
His own <i>Cassaria</i> appeared for the first time at Ferrara in 1508; the
<i>Suppositi</i> followed in 1509, and was reproduced at the Vatican in 1519.
It took Leo's fancy so much that he besought the author for another
comedy. Ariosto, in compliance with this request, completed the
<i>Negromante</i>, which he had already had in hand during the previous ten
years. The <i>Lena</i> was first represented at Ferrara in 1528, and the
<i>Scolastica</i> was left unfinished at the poet's death. What part Ariosto
took in the presentation of his comedies, is uncertain; but it is
probable that he helped in their performance, besides directing the
stage and reciting the prologue. He thus acquired a practical
acquaintance with theatrical management, and it was by his advice, and
on plans furnished by him, that Alfonso built the first permanent stage
at Ferrara in 1532. On the last day of that year, not long after its
erection, the theater was burned down. These dates are important; since
they prove that Ariosto's connection with the stage, as actor,
playwright, and manager, was continuous throughout his lifetime.</p>

<p>Ariosto's peaceful occupations at Ferrara were interrupted early in 1522
by what must be reckoned the strangest episode of his career. On
February 7 in that year, he was nominated Ducal Commissary for the
government of Garfagnana, a wild upland district stretching under Monte
Pellegrino almost across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">-500-</a></span> Apennines from the Lucchese to the
Modenese frontiers. We find that the salary allowed him by Alfonso had
never been very regularly paid, and that in 1521 the Duke, straitened in
means by his warfare with the Papacy, was compelled to suspend it
altogether.<a name="FNanchor_606_607" id="FNanchor_606_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_607" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> At the same period the Communes forming what is known
as Garfagnana (who had placed themselves beneath the Marquises of
Ferrara in the first half of the fifteenth century, but had lately
suffered from Florentine and Papal incursions) besought Alfonso to
assert his suzerainty of their district and to take measures for
securing its internal quiet. The emoluments of the Commissary amounted
to about 930 <i>lire marchesane</i>, estimated at something like 2,300 francs
of present value; and it was undoubtedly the pecuniary profits of the
office which induced the Duke to offer it, and the poet to accept it.</p>

<p>We may think it strange that so acute a judge of men as Alfonso should
have selected the author of the <i>Furioso</i>, a confirmed student, almost a
recluse in his habits, and already broken in health, for the
governorship of a district half-ruined by foreign raids and domestic
feuds, which had become the haunt of brigands and the asylum of bandits
from surrounding provinces. Yet we must remember that Ariosto had
already given ample proof of his good sense and business-like qualities,
not only in the administration of his own affairs, but in numerous
embassies undertaken for the Cardinal and Duke, his masters. At that
epoch of Italian history the name and fame of an illustrious writer were
themselves a power in politics:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">-501-</a></span> and it is said that during Ariosto's
first journey into Garfagnana, he owed his liberation from the hands of
brigands to the celebrity of the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>.<a name="FNanchor_607_608" id="FNanchor_607_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_608" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> Alfonso knew,
moreover, that the poet was well qualified for negotiating with princes;
and what was of grave practical importance, he stood in excellent
personal relations to the Medici, from whom as the rulers of Florence
the Garfagnana was menaced with invasion. These considerations are
sufficient to explain Alfonso's choice. Nothing but necessity would
probably have induced Ariosto to quit Ferrara for the intolerable
seclusion of those barbarous mountains; where it was his duty to issue
edicts against brigands, to hunt outlaws, to punish murderers and
robbers, to exact fines for rape and infamous offenses, to see that the
hangman did his duty, and to sit in judgment daily upon suits that
proved the savage immorality of the entire population. The hopelessness
of the task might have been enough to break a sterner heart than
Ariosto's, and his loathing of his life at Castelnovo found vent in the
most powerful of his satires. He managed to endure this uncongenial
existence for three years, from February 20, 1522, till June, 1525,
sustaining his spirits with correspondence and composition, and varying
the monotony of his life by visits to Ferrara. It was during his
Garfagnana residence in all probability that he composed the <i>Cinque
Canti</i>. The society of his dearly-loved son, Virginio&#8212;whose education
he superintended and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">-502-</a></span> whom he wrote the charming seventh Satire to
Pietro Bembo&#8212;also served to diminish the dreariness of his exile from
love, leisure, and the society of friends.</p>

<p>Virginio was Ariosto's natural son by a woman of Reggio. He collected
the Latin poems after his father's death, and prepared the <i>Cinque
Canti</i> for Manuzio's press in 1545. He also helped his uncle Gabriele to
finish <i>La Scolastica</i>, and wrote a few brief recollections of his
father. Ariosto had a second illegitimate son, named Giovanni Battista,
who distinguished himself in a military career.</p>

<p>The last eight years of Ariosto's life were spent in great tranquillity
at Ferrara. Soon after his return from Garfagnana he built his house in
the Contrada Mirasol, and placed upon it the following characteristic
inscription<a name="FNanchor_608_609" id="FNanchor_608_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_609" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
Parva sed apta mihi sed nulli obnoxia sed non<br />
<span class="ind1">Sordida parta meo sed tamen &#230;re domus.</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>About this time, too, he married the lady to whom for many years he had
been tenderly attached.<a name="FNanchor_609_610" id="FNanchor_609_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_610" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> She was the Florentine Alessandra Benucci,
widow of Tito Strozzi, whom he first saw at Florence in the year 1513.
The marriage was kept strictly secret, probably because the poet did not
choose to relinquish the income he derived from certain minor benefices.
Nor did it prove fruitful of offspring, for Ariosto left no legitimate
heirs. His life of tranquil study was varied <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">-503-</a></span>only by short journeys to
Venice, Abano, and Mantua. In 1531 he was sent to negotiate certain
matters for his master in the camp of the Marquis del Vasto at
Correggio. On this occasion he received from Alfonso Davalos a pension
of one hundred golden ducats, by a deed which sets forth in its preamble
the duty of princes to recompense poets who immortalize the acts of
heroes. This is the only instance of reward bestowed on Ariosto for his
purely literary merits. The poet repaid his benefactor by magnificent
eulogies inserted in the last edition of the <i>Furioso</i>.<a name="FNanchor_610_611" id="FNanchor_610_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_611" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Between the
year 1525, when he left Garfagnana, and 1532, when his poem issued from
the press, he devoted himself with unceasing labor to its revision and
improvement. The edition of 1516 consisted of forty cantos. That of 1532
contained forty-six, and the whole text had been subjected in the
interval to minute alterations.<a name="FNanchor_611_612" id="FNanchor_611_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_612" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> Not long after the publication of
the revised edition Ariosto's health gave way. His constitution had
never been robust, for he suffered habitually from a catarrh of the
lungs which made his old life as Ippolito d'Este's courier not only
distasteful but dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_612_613" id="FNanchor_612_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_613" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Toward the close of 1532 this complaint
took the form of a consumption, which ended his days on the sixth of
June, 1533. Great pains have been bestowed by his biographers on proving
that he died a good Catholic; nor is there any reason to suppose that he
neglected the consolations of the Church in his last hours. He was by no
means a man <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">-504-</a></span>to break abruptly with tradition or to make an indecorous
display of doubts that may have haunted him. Yet the best Latin verses
he ever penned were a half-humorous copy of hendecasyllables for his own
epitaph, which seem to prove that he applied Montaigne's <i>peut-&#234;tre</i>
even to the grave.<a name="FNanchor_613_614" id="FNanchor_613_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_614" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<p>Of Ariosto's personal habits and opinions we know unfortunately but
little, beyond what may be gathered from the incomparably transparent
self-revelation of his satires. His son, Virginio, who might have amply
satisfied our curiosity, confined himself to the fewest and briefest
details in the notes transcribed and published by Barotti. Some of
these, however, are so characteristic that it may not be inopportune to
translate them. With regard to his method of composition, Virginio
writes: &quot;He was never satisfied with his verses, but altered them again
and again, so that he could not keep his lines in his memory, and
consequently lost many of his compositions.... In horticulture he
followed the same system as in composition, for he would not leave
anything he planted for more than three months in one place; and if he
sowed peaches or any kind of seed, he went so often to see if they were
sprouting, that at last he broke the shoots. He had but small knowledge
of herbs, and used to think that whatever grew near the things he had
sown, were the plants themselves, and watched them diligently till his
mistake was proved beyond all doubt. I remember once, when he had
planted capers, he went every day to see them and was greatly delighted
at their luxuriance. At last he discerned that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">-505-</a></span> but elders,
and that the capers had not come up at all.... He was not much given to
study, and cared to see but few books. Virgil gave him pleasure, and
Tibullus for his diction; but he greatly commended Horace and Catullus,
Propertius not much.... He ate fast and much, and made no distinction of
food. So soon as he came home, if he found the bread set out, he would
eat one piece walking, while the meats were being brought to table. When
he saw them spread, he had water poured upon his hands and then began to
eat whatever was nearest to him.... He was fond of turnips.&quot;</p>

<p>From the bare details of Ariosto's biography it is satisfactory to turn
to the living picture of the man himself revealed in his Satires. These
compositions rank next to the <i>Orlando Furioso</i> in the literary canon of
his works, and have the highest value for the light they cast upon his
temperament and mode of feeling. Though they are commonly called
Satires, they rather deserve the name of Epistles; for while a satiric
element gives distinct flavor to each of the seven poems, this is
subordinated to personal and familiar topics of correspondence. We learn
from them what the great artist of the golden age thought and felt about
the times in which he lived; what moved his indignation or aroused his
sympathy; how he strove to meet the troubles of his checkered life; and
where, amid the carnival of that mad century, he laid his finger upon
hidden social maladies. Reading them, we come to know the man himself,
and are better able to understand how, while Italy was distracted with
wars and trampled on by foreign armies, he could withdraw him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">-506-</a></span>self from
the tumult, and spend his years in polishing the stanzas of <i>Orlando</i>.
The Satires do not reveal a hero or a sage, a poet passionate like Dante
with the sense of wrong, or like Petrarch aspiring after an impossible
ideal. It is rather the type of Boccaccio's character, refined and
purged of sensuality, with delicate touches of irony and a more
fastidious taste, that meets us in this portrait of Ariosto painted by
himself. His mental vision is more lucid, his judgment more acute, his
philosophy less indulgent, and his ideal of art more exacting; yet he,
too, might be nicknamed <i>Lodovico della Tranquillit&#224;</i>. With his head in
Philiroe's lap beside a limpid rivulet, he basks away the summer hours,
and cares not whether French or German get the upper hand in Italy.<a name="FNanchor_614_615" id="FNanchor_614_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_615" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>
Does it greatly signify, he asks Ercole Strozzi in one of his Latin
poems, whether we serve a French or an Italian tyrant? Servitude is the
same, if the despot be a barbarian only in manners, like our
princelings, or in name too, like these foreigners.<a name="FNanchor_615_616" id="FNanchor_615_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_616" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>Left alone to study and to polish verses, Ariosto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">-507-</a></span>is content. He is content to flatter and confer immortality on the
master he despises. He is content to rest in one place, turning his maps
over when he fain would take a journey into foreign lands. Only let him
be, and give him enough to live upon, and he will trouble no man,
dispute no pretender's claims, raise no inconvenient questions of right
and wrong, inflame the world with no far-reaching thoughts, but gild the
refined gold of his purest phrases and paint the lilies of his loveliest
thoughts in placid ease. Italy has grown old, and Ariosto is the genius
of a tired, world-weary, disillusioned age. What is there worth a
struggle? At the same time he preserves his independence as a private
gentleman. He passes free judgment upon society; and the patron he has
praised officially in his epic, receives hard justice in his Satires. He
is frank and honest, free from hypocrisy and guile, genial and loyal
toward his friends, upright in his dealings and manly in his instincts.
We respect his candor, his contempt for worldly honors, and his love of
liberty. We admire his intellectual sagacity, his deep and wise
philosophy of life, the knowledge of the world so easily communicated,
the irony so pungent yet so free from bitterness, which gives piquancy
to these familiar discourses. Still both respect and admiration are
tempered with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">-508-</a></span> regret that the greatest poet of the sixteenth
century should have been so easy-going. Such is the Ariosto revealed to
us by the Satires&#8212;not a noble or sublime being: by no means the man to
save the State if safety had been possible. Throughout the tragedy of
Italy's last years of freedom he moves, an essentially comic character,
only redeemed by genius and by <i>Weltweisheit</i> from the ridicule
attaching to a man whose aims are commonplace, and whose complaints
against the world are petty. He is not servile enough to accept the
humiliations of a courtier's lot without a murmur. He is not proud
enough to break his chains and live in haughty isolation. Hence in these
incomparable records of his private opinion, we find him at one moment
painting the discomforts of his position with a <i>na&#239;vet&#233;</i> that provokes
our laughter, at another analyzing the vices of society with luminous
acumen, then shrugging his shoulders and summoning philosophy to his aid
with a final cry of <i>Pazienza!</i></p>

<p>The motive of the first Epistle is a proposed journey to Rome.<a name="FNanchor_616_617" id="FNanchor_616_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_617" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> The
second enumerates the reasons why the poet will not accompany Ippolito
d'Este to Hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">-509-</a></span>gary. The subject of the third is the choice of a wife.
The fourth discusses the vanity of honors and wealth in comparison with
a contented mind. The fifth describes the poet's isolation in the
Garfagnana, and contains a confession of his love. In the sixth he
explains why he does not wish to go to Rome and seek advancement from
Clement VII. The seventh is devoted to the education of youth in the
humanities, and contains a retrospect of his own early life. The satire
of the first is directed against the ambition and avarice of priests,
the pride of Roman prelates, and the nepotism of the Popes. The passage
describing an ecclesiastic's levee is justly famous for its humor; and
the diatribe on Papal vices for its force. The second shows how the
dependents upon princes are forced to flatter, and how they exchange
their freedom for the empty honor of sitting near great men at table.
Ariosto takes occasion to describe the character of Ippolito d'Este, who
cared for his hawks and hounds more than for the Muses, and who paid his
body-servants better than the poet of Orlando.<a name="FNanchor_617_618" id="FNanchor_617_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_618" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> &quot;I owe you nothing,
Ph&#339;bus, nor you, holy college of the Muses! From you I never got enough
to buy myself a cloak. 'Indeed? your lord has given you....' More than
the price of several cloaks, I grant. But not for your sake, Muses, I am
certain. He has told me, and I do not mind repeating it, that my verses
are just worth the price of their waste paper. He will not give a penny
for my praises, but pays me for courier's service. His followers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">-510-</a></span> the
barge or villa, his <i>valet-de-chambre</i> and butler, his lackeys who
outwatch the night, get paid. But when I set his name with honor in my
verse, he tells me I have whiled my time away in ease and pleasure&#8212;I
had pleased him better by attendance on his person. If you remind me
that I owe to him a third of the Chancery dues at Milan, I answer that
he gave me this because I ply both spur and whip, change beasts and
guides, and hurry over hills and precipices, risking my life upon his
business.&quot;</p>

<p>The third Epistle is a masterpiece of sound counsel and ripe knowledge
of the world. Better rules could not be given about the precautions to
be taken in selecting a wife, the qualities a man should seek in her,
and the conduct he should use toward her after marriage. The satire
consists in that poor opinion of female honesty which the author of the
<i>Furioso</i> had conceived, not without much experience of women, and after
mature reflection upon social institutions. It is not envenomed like the
invectives of the <i>Corbaccio</i>, or exaggerated like the abuse in
Alberti's dialogues. Leaning back in his arm-chair with an amused and
quiet smile, the indulgent satirist enunciates truths that are biting
only because they condense the wisdom of an observant lifetime. He never
ceases to be kindly; and we feel, while listening to him, that his
epigrams are double-edged. The poet who has learned thus much of women,
gives the measure of his limited capacity for noble feeling; for while
he paints them as he finds them, he leaves an impression of his own
emotional banality. After making due allowance for this defect in
Ariosto's point of view, we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">-511-</a></span> rank the third Epistle among the ripest
products of his intellect. The fourth resumes the theme of Court-life
and place-hunting. &quot;You ask me, friend Annibale, how I fare with Duke
Alfonso, and whether I find his service lighter than the Cardinal's. To
tell the truth, I do not like one burden better than the other; and were
I rich enough, I certainly would be no man's servant. But I was not born
an only son, and Mercury was never generous to my race. So I am forced
to live at a patron's charge, and it is better to owe my maintenance to
the Duke than to beg bread from door to door. I know that most people
think it a grand thing to be a courtier, but I count Court-life as mere
slavery. A nightingale is ill at ease in a cage, and a swallow dies
after a day's imprisonment. If a man wants to be decorated with the
spurs or the red hat, let him serve kings or popes. For my part, I care
for neither; a turnip in my own house tastes sweeter to me than a
banquet in a master's.<a name="FNanchor_618_619" id="FNanchor_618_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_619" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> I would rather stretch my lazy limbs in my
armchair than be able to boast that I had traveled over half the globe.
I have seen Tuscany, Lombardy, Romagna, the Apennines and Alps, the
Adriatic and the Mediterranean. That is enough for me. The rest of the
world I can visit at my leisure with Ptolemy for guide. The Duke's
service has this advantage, that it does not interrupt my studies, or
take me far from Ferrara, where my heart is always. I think I hear you
laughing at this point, and saying that neither love of study nor of
country, but a woman ties me to my home. Well:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">-512-</a></span> I will confess it
frankly. But suppose I had gone to Rome to fish for benefices, says some
one, I should certainly have netted more than one, especially as I was
Leo's friend before his merits or his luck raised him to the highest
earthly station. I knew him at Urbino when he cheered his exile with
Castiglione and Bembo; and afterwards when he returned to Florence, he
bade me count upon him like a brother. All this is true; but listen to a
fable I will tell you.<a name="FNanchor_619_620" id="FNanchor_619_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_620" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> In time of drought, when there was no water
to be had in all the country, a shepherd found a scanty spring. He drank
of it first, and next his wife, and then his children, and afterwards
his servants and his cattle. Last of all there came a magpie he had
petted in old days; but the bird saw that she had no right to drink of
the fountain, for she was neither wife nor child nor hind, nor could she
bring wealth to the household.<a name="FNanchor_620_621" id="FNanchor_620_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_621" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> It is just the same with me. Leo has
all the Medici, and all his friends in exile, who risked their lives and
fortunes for him, and all the priests who made him pope, to recompense.
What is there left for me? It is true that he has not forgotten me. When
I went to Rome and kissed his foot, he bent down from the holy seat, and
took my hand and saluted me on both cheeks. Besides, he made me free of
half the stamp-dues I was bound to pay; and then, breast-full of hope
but soaked with rain and smirched with mud, I went and had my <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">-513-</a></span>supper at
the Ram!<a name="FNanchor_621_622" id="FNanchor_621_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_622" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> But supposing the Pope kept all his promises and put as
many miters on my head as Michelangelo's Jonah sees beneath him in the
Sistine Chapel, what would this profit me? No amount of wealth can
satisfy desire. Honors and riches do not bring tranquillity of mind.
True honor is, to be esteemed an honest man, and to be this in good
earnest; for if you are not really one, you will be detected. What is
the advantage of wearing fine clothes and being bowed to in the
market-place, if people point you out behind your back as thief and
traitor? There are dignities which are notorious disgraces; and the
richer and greater a man is who has gained his rank dishonorably, the
more he calls attention to his shame.&quot;</p>

<p>In the sixth Epistle written in the Garfagnana, Ariosto still further
develops the same theme. His friend, Pistofilo, had advised him to go to
Rome and seek preferment from Clement VII. &quot;What would be the use?&quot; he
argues. &quot;I have as much of worldly honor as I care for; and if Leo did
not find it in his power to help me, I cannot expect anything from the
other Medici. Nay, my friend, bait your hook with more enticing
dainties: remind me of Bembo, Sadoleto, Giovio, Vida, Molza, Tibaldeo;
in whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">-514-</a></span> company I might wander over the seven hills: or speak to me
about the libraries of Rome. Not even these allurements would move me;
for if I had to live away from Ferrara, I should not be happy in the lap
of Jove. Existence is only made endurable by occasional visits to the
town I love; and if the Duke wishes to fulfill my desires, he must
recall me to himself and make me stationary at Ferrara. Why do I cling
so to that place, you ask me? I would as lief tell you as confess my
worst crimes to a friar. I am forty-nine years of age, and too old to be
the slave of love.&quot; The conclusion of the sixth Epistle makes it clear
that his residence at Castelnovo was irksome to the poet because it
forced him to be absent from the woman he loved. But the fifth is even
more explicit. &quot;This day completes the first year of my exile among
these barbarous mountains, dead to the Muses, divided by snows, fells,
forests, rivers, from the mistress of my soul!<a name="FNanchor_622_623" id="FNanchor_622_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_623" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> I am nearly fifty,
and yet love rules me like a beardless boy. Well: this weakness is at
least pardonable. I do not commit murder; I do not smite or stab, or vex
my neighbors. I am not consumed with avarice, ambition, prodigality, or
monstrous lust. But in this doleful place my heart fails me. I cannot
write poetry as I used to do at Reggio when life was young. Imprisoned
between the naked heights of Pania and Pellegrino's precipices, the wild
steeps of these woody Apennines inclose me in a living grave. Here in
the castle, or out there in the open air, my ears are deaf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">-515-</a></span>ened with
continual law-suits, accusations, brawls. Theft, murder, hatred,
vengeance, anger, furnish me with occupation day and night. My time is
spent in threatening, punishing, persuading, or acquitting. I write
dispatches daily to the Duke for counsel or for aid against the bandits
that encompass me. The whole province is disorganized with brigandage,
and its eighty-three villages are in a state of chronic discord. Is it
likely then that Ph&#339;bus, when I call him, will quit Delphi for this
den? You ask me why I left my mistress and my studies for so dolorous a
cave of care. I was never greedy of money, and my stipend at Ferrara
satisfied me, until the war stopped it altogether, as well as my profits
from the Chancery at Milan. When I asked the Duke for help, it so
happened that the Garfagnana wanted a Governor, and he sent me here with
more regard for my necessities than for the needs of the people under my
care. I am grateful to him for his good will; but though his gift is
costly, it is not to my mind. So I am like the cock who found a jewel on
his dungheap, or like the Venetian who had a fine horse given him and
could not ride it.&quot;</p>

<p>The satirical passages in this Epistle can be separated from its
autobiography, and furnish striking specimens of Ariosto's style. In
order to show how ill the world judges of the faults and follies of
great men, he draws a series of portraits with a few but telling
touches. Though furnished with fictitious names, they suit the persons
of the time to a nicety. This, for example, is Francesco Guicciardini,
as Pitti represented him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">-516-</a></span></p>

<p>Autobiography and satire are mingled in the same unequal proportions in
the seventh Epistle, which is perhaps the most interesting poem of the
series. &quot;Bembo,&quot; so begins the letter, &quot;I want my son Virginio to be
well taught in the arts that elevate a man. You possess them all: I
therefore ask you to recommend me a good Greek tutor at Venice or Padua,
in whose house the youth may live and study. The Greek must be learned,
but also of sound principles, for erudition without morality is worse
than worthless. Unhappily, in these days it is difficult to find a
teacher of this sort. Few humanists are free from the most infamous of
vices, and intellectual vanity makes most of them skeptics also. Why is
it that learning and infidelity go hand in hand? Why do our scholars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">-517-</a></span>
Latinize their names of baptism, changing Peter into Pierius, and John
into Janus, or Jovianus? Plato was right when he expelled such poets
from his State. Little have they in common with Ph&#339;bus and Amphion who
taught civil life to barbarous races. For myself, it stings me to the
quick when men of my own profession are proved thus vain and vicious.
Find, then, an honest tutor to instruct Virginio in Greek. I have
already taught him Latin; but the difficulties of my early manhood
deprived me of Greek learning. My father drove me at the spear's point
into legal studies. I wasted five years in that trifling, and it was not
till I was twenty that I found a teacher in Gregorio da Spoleto. He
began by grounding me in Latin; but before we had advanced to Greek, the
good man was summoned to Milan. His pupil, Francesco Sforza, went with
Il Moro, a prisoner, into France. Gregorio followed him, and died there.
Then my father died and left me the charge of my younger brothers and
sisters. I had to neglect study and become a strict economist. Next my
dear relative Pandolfo Ariosto, the best and ablest of our house, died;
and, as if these losses were not enough, I found myself beneath the yoke
of Ippolito d'Este. All through the reign of Julius II. and for seven
years of Leo's pontificate he kept me on the move from place to place,
and made me courier instead of poet. Small chance had I of learning
Greek or Hebrew on those mountain roads.&quot;</p>

<p>These abstracts of Ariosto's so-called Satires will not be reckoned
superfluous when we consider the clear light they cast upon his personal
character and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">-518-</a></span> philosophy. The note of sincerity throughout is
unmistakable. No one can read the pure and simple language of the poet
without feeling that his mind was as transparent as his style, his
character as ingenuous as his diction was perspicuous. When he tells us,
for example, that he does not care for honors, that he prefers his study
to the halls of princes, and that a turnip in his own house tastes
better than the pheasants of a ducal table, we believe him. His
confession of unseasonable love, and his acknowledgment that he has none
of the qualities of judge or ruler, are a security for equal frankness
when he professes himself free from avarice and the common vices of his
age. His satire upon women, his picture of the Roman prelates, his
portraits of great men, and his condemnation of the humanists are
convincing by their very moderation. Like Horace, he plays about the
heart instead of wielding the whip of Lucilius. This parsimony of
expression adds weight to his censure, and renders these epistles more
decisive than the invectives in which contemporary authors indulged. We
doubt the calumnies of Poggio and Filelfo until we read the
well-considered passage of the seventh Epistle, which includes them
all.<a name="FNanchor_624_625" id="FNanchor_624_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_625" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> In like manner the last lines of the fourth Epistle confirm
the Diaries of Burchard and Infessura, while the first contains an
epitome of all that could be said of Alexander's nepotism. These
familiar poems have, therefore, a singular value for the illustration of
the Italian Renaissance in general no less than for that of Ariosto's
own life. Furthermore, they are unique in the annals of Italian
literature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">-519-</a></span> The <i>terza rima</i> of Dante's vision has here become a
vehicle for poetry separated by the narrowest interval from prose. It no
longer lends itself to parody, as in the <i>Beoni</i> of Lorenzo de' Medici.
It is not contaminated by the foul frivolities of the Bernesque
<i>Capitoli</i>. It takes with accuracy the impress of the writer's common
thought and feeling. The meter designed to express a sublime belief,
adapts itself to the discursive utterance of a man of sense and culture
in a disillusioned age; and thus we might use the varying fortunes of
<i>terza rima</i> to symbolize the passage from the <i>trecento</i> to the <i>cinque
cento</i>, from Dante to Ariosto, from faith and inspiration to art and
reflection.</p>

<p>Ariosto's minor poems, with but one or two exceptions, have direct
reference to the circumstances of his life. They consist of Elegies,
Capitoli, and an Eclogue composed in <i>terza rima</i>, with Canzoni,
Sonnets, and Madrigals of the type made obligatory by Petrarch. The poet
of the <i>Orlando</i> was not great in lyric verse. These lesser compositions
show his mastery of simple and perspicuous style; but the specific
qualities of his best work, its color and imagery and pointed humor, are
absent. The language is sometimes pedestrian in directness, sometimes
encumbered with conceits that anticipate the taste of the seventeenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_625_626" id="FNanchor_625_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_626" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> Where it is plainest, we lack the seasoning of epigram and
illustration which enlivens the Satires; and though the sincere feeling
and Ovidian fluency of the more ambitious lyrics render them delightful
reading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">-520-</a></span> we acknowledge that a wider channel of description or
narrative or reflection was needed for the full tide of the poet's
eloquence. The purely subjective style was hardly suited to his genius.</p>

<p>Only three <i>Canzoni</i> are admitted into the canon of Ariosto's works. The
first relates the origin of his love for Alessandra Benucci, wife of
Tito Strozzi, whom he admired as wife and married as widow. It was on S.
John's Day in the year 1513 that he saw her at Florence among the gay
crowd of the midsummer festival. She was dressed in black silk
embroidered with two vines, her golden hair twisted into heavy braids,
and her forehead overshadowed with a jeweled laurel-wreath. The
brightness of the scene was blotted out for the poet, and swallowed in
the intense luster of her beauty:</p>

<p>How much he admired Florence, he tells us in the fourteenth elegy, where
this famous compliment occurs:</p>

<p>The second <i>Canzone</i> is supposed to be spoken by the soul of Giuliano
de' Medici, Duke of Nemours, to his widow, Filiberta of Savoy. Elevation
of conception raises the language of this poem to occasional sublimity,
as in the passage where he speaks of immortality:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">-521-</a></span></p>

<p>The undulation of rhythm obeying the thought renders these lines in a
high sense musical.</p>

<p>Some of the Elegies have been already used in illustration of other
poems. There remain a group apart, which seem to have been directly
modeled upon Ovid. Of these the sixth, describing a night of love, and
the seventh, when the lover dares not enter his lady's door in moonlight
lest he should be seen, are among the finest. The ninth, upon fidelity
in love, contains these noble lines:</p>

</table>

<p>The second is written on the famous black pen fringed with gold, which
Ariosto adopted for his device and wore embroidered on his clothes. He
declines to explain the meaning of this bearing; but it is commonly
believed to have referred in some way to his love for Alessandra
Strozzi. Baruffaldi conjectures that her black dress and golden hair
suggested the two colors. But since this elegy threatens curious
inquirers with Act&#230;on's fate, we may leave his device to the obscurity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">-522-</a></span>
he sought. Secrecy in respect to the great passion of his life was
jealously maintained by Ariosto. His ink-stand at Ferrara still bears a
Cupid with one finger on his lip, as though to bid posterity observe the
reticence adopted by the poet in his lifetime.</p>

<p>The Madrigals and Sonnets do not add much to our conception of Ariosto's
genius. It has been well remarked that while his Latin love-poems echo
the style of Horace, these are imitations of Petrarch's manner.<a name="FNanchor_626_627" id="FNanchor_626_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_627" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> In
the former he celebrates the facile attractions of Lydia and Megilla, or
confesses that he is inconstant in every thing except in always varying
his loves.<a name="FNanchor_627_628" id="FNanchor_627_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_628" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> In the latter he professes to admire a beautiful soul
and eloquent lips more than physical charms, praises the spiritual
excellences of his mistress, and writes complimentary sonnets on her
golden hair.<a name="FNanchor_628_629" id="FNanchor_628_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_629" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> In neither case is there any insincerity. Ariosto
never pretended to be a platonic lover, nor did he credit women with
great nobility of nature. Yet on the other hand it is certain that he
was no less tenderly than passionately attached to Alessandra; and this
serious love, of which the Sonnets are perhaps the record, triumphed
over the volatility of his earlier affections.</p>

<p>It is enough in this chapter to have dealt with Ariosto's life and minor
writings. The <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, considered both as the masterpiece of
his genius and also as the representative poem of the Italian
Renaissance, must form the subject of a separate study.</p>

<h3><i>Note on Italian Heroic Verse.</i></h3>

<p class="center">(See above, <a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>.)</p>


<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">The</span> Italian hendecasyllable is an accentual iambic line of five feet
with one unaccented syllable over and included in the rhyme. Thus the
first line of the <i>Inferno</i> may be divided:&#8212;</p>

<p class="center">Nel mez|zo del | cammin | di nos|tra vita.</p>

<p>When the verse is so constructed, it is said to be <i>piano</i>, the rhyme
being what in English we call double. When the rhyme is single, the
verse is <i>tronco</i>, and the rhythm corresponds to that of our heroic, as
in the following instance (<i>Par.</i> xxv. 102):</p>

<p class="center">Il ver|no avreb|be un me|se d'un | sol d&#236;.</p>

<p>When the rhyme is treble, the verse is <i>sdrucciolo</i>, of which form this
is a specimen (<i>Par.</i> xxvi. 78):</p>

<p class="center">Che ri|fulge|va pi&#249; | di mil|le milia.</p>

<p>It is clear that the quality of the verse is not affected by the number
of syllables in the rhyme; and the line is called hendecasyllabic
because <i>versi piani</i> are immeasurably more frequent and more agreeable
to the ear than either <i>versi tronchi</i> or <i>sdruccioli</i>.</p>

<p>If we inquire into the origin of the meter, the first remark we have to
make is that lines of similar construction were used by poets of
Provence. Dante, for example, quotes (<i>De Vulg. Eloq.</i> ii. 2) from
Bertram:</p>

<p class="center">Non puesc mudar q'un chantar non esparja.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">-524-</a></span></p>

<p>This fact will seem to many minds conclusive on the point in question.
But, following the investigations of recent scholars, we find this form
of verse pretty generally referred to the watch-song of the Modenese
soldiers. Thus Professor Adolfo Bartoli, after quoting two lines of that
song,</p>

<p>adds: &quot;qu&#236; apparisce per la prima volta il nostro verso endecasillabo,
regolarmente accentato.&quot; If this, which is the view accepted by Italian
critics, be right, he ought to have added that each line of the Modenese
watch-song is a <i>sdrucciolo</i> verse. Otherwise, the rhythm bears the
appearance of a six-foot accentual iambic, an appearance which is
confirmed by the recurrence of a single rhyme or assonance in <i>a</i>
throughout the poem. Still the strong accent on the antepenultimate
syllable of every verse is sufficient to justify us in regarding the
meter as <i>endecasillabo sdrucciolo</i>.</p>

<p>Going further back than the Modenese watch-song (date about 924), the
next question is whether any of the classic meters supplied its
precedent. By reading either Horatian Sapphics or Catullian
hendecasyllables without attention to quantity, we may succeed in
marking the beat of the <i>endecasillabo piano</i>.<a name="FNanchor_629_630" id="FNanchor_629_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_630" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> Thus:</p>

<p class="center">Cui do|no lep|idum | novum | libellum?</p>

<p>and:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
Serus | in coe|lum red|eas, | diuque<br />
L&#230;tus | inter|sis po|pulo | Quirini.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When these lines are translated into literal Italian, the metamorphosis
is complete. Thus:</p>

<p class="center">Cui don|o il lep|ido | nuovo | libretto?</p>

<p>and:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
Tardo in | ciel ried|i e di|utur|no serba<br />
Fausto il | tuo aspet|to al pop|ol di | Quirino.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Even Alcaics, unceremoniously handled by a shifting of the accent, which
is violent disregard of quantity, yield like results. Thus:</p>

<p class="center">
Atqui | scie | bat qu&#230; | sibi | barbarus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">-525-</a></span></p>

<p>Or in Italian:</p>

<p class="center">
Eppur | conob|be ci&#242; | ch'il man|igoldo.</p>

<p>The accentual Sapphics of the middle ages throw some curious light upon
these transmutations of meter. In a lament for Aquileia (tenth century)
we find these lines:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
Bella sublimis inclyta divitiis,<br />
Olim fuisti celsa &#230;dificiis.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Here, instead of the Latin Sapphic, we get a loose <i>sdrucciolo</i> rhythm.
The meter of the Serventese seems built upon this medieval Sapphic
model. Here is an example<a name="FNanchor_630_631" id="FNanchor_630_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_631" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
O Jeso Cristo, padre onipotente,<br />
Aprestame lo core con la mente<br />
Che rasonare possa certamente<br />
<span class="ind6">Un servientese.</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When the humanistic Italians tried to write Italian Sapphics, they
produced a meter not very dissimilar. Thus in the <i>Certamen
Coronarium</i><a name="FNanchor_631_632" id="FNanchor_631_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_632" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
Eccomi, i' son qui Dea degli amici,<br />
Quella qual tutti li omini solete<br />
Mordere, e falso fuggitiva dirli<br />
<span class="ind8">Or la volete.</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>What seems tolerably certain is that the modern Italian hendecasyllable
was suggested by one of the Latin eleven-syllabled meters, but that, in
the decay of quantitative prosody, an iambic rhythm asserted itself. It
has no exact correspondence in any classic meter; but it was early
developed out of the accentual Latin measures which replaced
quantitative meter in the middle ages. Signor Rubieri points out that
there may be traces of it in the verses of Etruscan inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_632_633" id="FNanchor_632_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_633" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>
Nor is it impossible that the rhythm was indigenous, persisting through
a long period of Gr&#230;co-Roman culture, to reappear when the rustic
language threw out a modern idiom.</p>

<p>Here the miserable translation ends. But I would that I could summon
from the deeps of memory some echo of the voice I heard at Perugia, one
dark Good Friday evening, singing Penitential Psalms. This made me feel
of what sort was the <i>Corrotto</i>, chanted by the confraternities of
Umbria. The psalms were sung on that occasion to a monotonous rhythm of
melodiously simple outline by three solo voices in turn&#8212;soprano, tenor,
and bass. At the ending of each psalm a candle before the high-altar was
extinguished, until all light and hope and spiritual life went out for
the damned soul. The soprano, who sustained the part of pathos, had the
fullness of a powerful man's chest and larynx, with the pitch of a
woman's and the timbre of a boy's voice. He seemed able to do what he
chose in prolonging and sustaining notes, with wonderful effects of
<i>crescendo</i> and <i>diminuendo</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">-539-</a></span> passing from the wildest and most piercing
<i>forte</i> to the tenderest <i>pianissimo</i>. He was hidden in the organ-loft;
and as he sang, the organist sustained his cry with long-drawn
shuddering chords and deep groans of the diapason. The whole church
throbbed with the vibrations of the rising, falling melody; and the
emotional thrill was as though Christ's or Mary's soul were speaking
through the darkness to our hearts. I never elsewhere heard a soprano of
this sort sing in tune so perfect or with so pure an intonation. The
dramatic effect produced by the contrast between this soprano and the
bass and tenor was simple but exceedingly striking. Englishmen, familiar
with cathedral music, may have derived a somewhat similar impression
from the more complex Motett of Mendelssohn upon Psalm xxii. I think
that when the Umbrian Laud began to be dramatic, the parts in such a
hymn as Jacopone's <i>Corrotto</i> must have been distributed after the
manner of these Perugian Good Friday services. Mary's was undoubtedly
given to the soprano; that of the Jews, possibly, to the bass; Christ's,
and perhaps the messenger's also, to the tenor. And it is possible that
the rhythm was almost identical with what I heard; for that had every
mark of venerable antiquity and popular sincerity.</p>

<p>I now pass to the Hymn of Divine Love, which Tresatti entitles <i>Cantico
dell'Amore Superardente</i> (Book vi. 16). It consists of three hundred and
seventy lines, all of which I have translated, though I content myself
here with some extracts:</p>

O Love of Charity!<br />
Why didst thou so wound me?<br />
Why breaks my heart through thee,<br />
My heart which burns with Love?<br />
<br />
<span class="ind2">It burns and glows and finds no place to stay;</span><br />
It cannot fly, for it is bound so tight;<br />
It melts like wax before the flame away;<br />
Living, it dies; swoons, faints, dissolves outright;<br />
Prays for the force to fly some little way;<br />
Finds itself in the furnace fiery-white;<br />
Ah me, in this sore plight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">-540-</a></span><br />
Who, what consumes my breath?<br />
Ah, thus to live is death!<br />
So swell the flames of Love.<br />
<br />
<span class="ind2">Or ere I tasted Jesus, I besought</span><br />
To love him, dreaming pure delights to prove,<br />
And dwell at peace mid sweet things honey-fraught,<br />
Far from all pain on those pure heights above:<br />
Now find I torment other than I sought;<br />
I knew not that my heart would break for love!<br />
There is no image of<br />
The semblance of my plight!<br />
I die, drowned in delight,<br />
And live heart-lost in Love!<br />
<br />
<span class="ind2">Lost is my heart and all my reason gone,</span><br />
My will, my liking, and all sentiment;<br />
Beauty is mere vile mud for eyes to shun;<br />
Soft cheer and wealth are naught but detriment;<br />
One tree of love, laden with fruit, but one,<br />
Fixed in my heart, supplies me nourishment:<br />
Hourly therefrom are sent,<br />
With force that never tires<br />
But varies still, desires,<br />
Strength, sense, the gifts of Love.

Answered Margutte: &quot;Friend, I never boasted:<br />
I don't believe in black more than in blue,<br />
But in fat capons, boiled, or may be roasted;<br />
And I believe sometimes in butter too,<br />
In beer and must, where bobs a pippin toasted;<br />
Sharp liquor more than sweet I reckon true;<br />
But mostly to old wine my faith I pin,<br />
And hold him saved who firmly trusts therein.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe in the tartlet and the tart;<br />
One is the mother, t'other is her son:<br />
The perfect paternoster is a part<br />
Of liver, fried in slips, three, two, or one;<br />
Which also from the primal liver start:<br />
And since I'm dry, and fain would swill a tun,<br />
If Mahomet forbids the juice of grape,<br />
I reckon him a nightmare, phantom, ape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apollo's naught but a delirious vision,<br />
And Trivigant perchance a midnight specter;<br />
Faith, like the itch, is catching; what revision<br />
This sentence needs, you'll make, nor ask the rector:<br />
To waste no words, you may without misprision<br />
Dub me as rank a heretic as Hector:<br />
I don't disgrace my lineage, nor indeed<br />
Am I the cabbage-ground for any creed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Faith's as man gets it, this, that, or another!<br />
See then what sort of creed I'm bound to follow:<br />
For you must know a Greek nun was my mother,<br />
My sire at Brusa, mid the Turks, a mollah;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">-544-</a></span><br />
I played the rebeck first, and made a pother<br />
About the Trojan war, flattered Apollo,<br />
Praised up Achilles, Hector, Helen fair,<br />
Not once, but twenty thousand times, I swear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next, growing weary of my light guitar,<br />
I donned a military bow and quiver;<br />
One day within the mosque I went to war,<br />
And shot my grave old daddy through the liver:<br />
Then to my loins I girt this scimitar,<br />
And journeyed forth o'er sea, land, town, and river<br />
Taking for comrades in each holy work<br />
The congregated sins of Greek and Turk.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's much the same as all the sins of hell!<br />
I've seventy-seven at least about me, mortal;<br />
Summer and winter in my breast they swell:<br />
Guess now how many venial crowd the portal!<br />
'Twere quite impossible, I know full well,<br />
If the world never ended, to report all<br />
The crimes I've done in this one life alone;<br />
Each item too is catalogued and known.<br />
<br />
&quot;I pray you listen for one little minute;<br />
The skein shall be unraveled in a trice:&#8212;<br />
When I've got cash, I'm gay as any linnet,<br />
Cast with who calls, cut cards, and fling the dice;<br />
All times, all places, or the devil's in it,<br />
Serve me for play; I've spent on this one vice<br />
Fame, fortune&#8212;staked my coat, my shirt, my breeches;<br />
I hope this specimen will meet your wishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't ask what juggler's tricks I teach the boxes!<br />
Or whether sixes serve me when I call,<br />
Or jumps an ace up!&#8212;Foxes pair with foxes;<br />
The same pitch tars our fingers, one and all!&#8212;<br />
Perhaps I don't know how to fleece the doxies?<br />
Perhaps I can't cheat, cozen, swindle, bawl?<br />
Perhaps I never learned to patter slang?&#8212;<br />

<br />
&quot;Gluttony after gambling's my prime pleasure.<br />
Here it behooves one to be learned and wise,<br />
To gauge the merits and the virtues measure<br />
Of pheasant, partridge, fowl; with practiced eyes<br />
Noting each part, of every dish at leisure,<br />
Seeking where tender slice or morsel lies;<br />
And since I've touched upon this point, I'll tell ye<br />
How best to grease your jaws and stuff your belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I could only show you how I baste,<br />
If you could see me turn the spit and ladle,<br />
You'd swear I had a most consummate taste!<br />
Of what ingredients are black-puddings made all?<br />
Not to be burned, and not to run to waste,<br />
Not over-hot nor frozen in the cradle,<br />
Done to a turn, juicy, not bathed in butter,<br />
Smooth, plump and swelling!&#8212;Don't you hear 'em sputter?<br />
<br />
&quot;About fried liver now receive my say:<br />
It wants five pieces&#8212;count them on your fingers;<br />
It must be round&#8212;keep this in mind, I pray!&#8212;<br />
Fire on this side or that the frying injures!<br />
Be careful not to brush the fat away,<br />
Which keeps the stew soft while it drops and lingers;<br />
You must divide it in two parts, and see<br />
That each part is apportioned equally.<br />
<br />
&quot;It should not be too large; but there's a saw&#8212;<br />
Stint not your bag-pudding of hose and jacket:<br />
Now mark me, for I'm laying down the law&#8212;<br />
Don't overcook the morsel in the packet;<br />
It ought to melt, midway twixt done and raw,<br />
Like a ripe autumn fig, when you attack it:<br />
Serve it up hissing, and then sound the tabors<br />
With spice and orange peel, to end your labors!<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got a hundred hints to give the wary!<br />
But take it on my word, ragouts and pies<br />
Are the true test of science culinary:<br />
A lamprey now&#8212;you'd scarce believe your eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">-546-</a></span><br />
To see its stews and salmis, how they vary!<br />
Yet all are known and numbered by the wise.&#8212;<br />
True gourmandize hath seventy-two divisions,<br />
Besides a few that are my own additions:<br />
<br />
&quot;If one be missed, the cooking's spoiled, that's granted:<br />
Not heaven itself can save a ruined platter!&#8212;<br />
From now till noon I'd hold your sense enchanted<br />
With secrets of my art, if I dared chatter!&#8212;<br />
I kept an inn at Corinth once, and wanted<br />
To argue publicly upon the matter.&#8212;<br />
But we must leave this point, for 'twill divert you<br />
To hear about another cardinal virtue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only to F these confidences carry;<br />
Just think what 'twill be when we come to R!<br />
I plow (no nonsense) with ass, cassiowary,<br />
Ox, camel&#8212;any other beast bizarre.<br />
A thousand bonfires, prisons, by Lord Harry,<br />
My tricks have earned, and something uglier far:<br />
Where my head will not pass, I stick my tail in,<br />
And what I like's to hear the good folk railing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take me to balls, to banquets, for an airing;<br />
I'll do my duty there with hands and feet:<br />
I'm rude, importunate, a bore, and daring;<br />
On friends no less than foes I'll take a seat:<br />
To shame I've said farewell; nor am I sparing<br />
Of fawning like a cur when kicks I meet,<br />
But tell my tale and swagger up and down,<br />
And with a thousand fibs each exploit crown.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to ask if I've kept geese at grass,<br />
Purveyed stewed prunes, taught kittens how to play.<br />
Suppose a thousand&#8212;widow, wife, and lass:<br />
That's just about my figure, I dare say.<br />
When mid the women by mishap I pass,<br />
Six out of every five become my prey;<br />
I make the pretty dears so deuc&#233;d cunning,<br />
They beat nurse, maid, duenna out of running.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">-547-</a></span><br />
<br />
&quot;Three of my moral qualities are these&#8212;<br />
Gluttony, dicing, as I said, and drinking:<br />
But, since we'll drain the barrel to the lees,<br />
Hear now the fourth and foremost to my thinking.<br />
No need of hooks or ladders, crows or keys,<br />
I promise, where my hands are! Without blinking<br />
I've worn the cross and miter on my forehead&#8212;<br />
No pope's nor priest's, but something much more horrid!<br />
<br />
&quot;Screws, files and jemmies are my stock in trade,<br />
Springs, picklocks, of more sorts than I could mention;<br />
Rope and wood ladders, levers, slippers made<br />
Of noiseless felt&#8212;my patented invention&#8212;<br />
Drowsing all ears, where'er my feet are laid;<br />
I fashioned them to take my mind's intention;<br />
Fire too that by itself no light delivers,<br />
But when I spit on it, springs up and quivers.<br />
<br />
&quot;See me but in a church alone and frisky!<br />
I'm keener on the robbing of an altar<br />
Than gaugers when they scent a keg of whiskey;<br />
Then to the alms-box off I fly, nor falter:<br />
Sacristies are my passion; though 'tis risky,<br />
With cross and sacring cup I never palter,<br />
But pull the crucifixes down and stow 'em&#8212;<br />
Virgins and saints and effigies, you know 'em!<br />
<br />
&quot;I've swept, may-be, a hen-roost in my day<br />
And if you'd seen me loot a lot of washing,<br />
You'd swear that never maid or housewife gay<br />
Could clear it in a style so smart and dashing!<br />
If naught, Morgante, 's left but blooming May<br />
To strip, I steal it&#8212;I can't keep from flashing!<br />
I ne'er drew difference twixt thine and mine:<br />
All things, to start with, were effects divine.<br />
<br />
&quot;But ere I learned to thieve thus on the sly,<br />
I ran the highway rig as bold as any;<br />
I would have robbed the biggest saint on high&#8212;<br />
If there <i>are</i> saints above us&#8212;for a penny;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">-548-</a></span><br />
But loving peace and fair tranquillity,<br />
I left assassination to the many:<br />
Not that my will was weak&#8212;I'd rather say,<br />
Because theft mixed with murder does not pay.<br />
<br />
&quot;My virtues theological now smile on!<br />
God knows if I can forge or falsify:<br />
I'll turn an H into a Greek Upsilon&#8212;<br />
You could not write a neater, prettier Y!<br />
I gut the pages of a book, and pile on<br />
New rubrics for new chapters, change the die,<br />
Change title, cover, index, name&#8212;the poet<br />
Who wrote the verse I counterfeit, won't know it.<br />
<br />
&quot;False oaths and perjuries come trickling down<br />
Out of my mouth as smooth and sweet as honey,<br />
Ripe figs, or macaroni nicely brown,<br />
Or anything that's natural and funny:<br />
Suppose they brain some guileless count or clown;<br />
All's one; ware heads, I cry, and pouch my money!<br />
I've set on foot full many a strife and wrangle,<br />
And left 'em in inextricable tangle.<br />
<br />
&quot;With ready coin I always square a scandal:<br />
Of oaths I've got a perfect stock in trade;<br />
Each saint supplies my speech with some choice handle;<br />
I run them off in rows from A to Z:<br />
In lying no man holds to me a candle;<br />
Truth's always the reverse of what I've said:&#8212;<br />
I'd like to see more fire than land or water,<br />
In heaven and earth naught but plague, famine, slaughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't fancy that in fasting, prayer and prate,<br />
Or charities my spare time I employ!<br />
Not to seem stiff, I beg from gate to gate,<br />
And always utter something to annoy:<br />
Proud, envious, tiresome and importunate&#8212;<br />
This character I've cherished from a boy;<br />
For the seven deadly sins and all the other<br />
Vices have brought me up to be their brother!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">-549-</a></span><br />
<br />
&quot;So that I'd roam the world, cross ban and border,<br />
Hood-winked, nor ever fear to miss my way;<br />
As sweet and clean as any lump of ordure,<br />
I leave my trail like slugs where'er I stray,<br />
Nor seek to hide that slimy self-recorder:<br />
Creeds, customs, friends I slough from day to day;<br />
Change skin and climate, as it suits me best,<br />
For I was evil even in the nest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've left a whole long chapter undiscussed<br />
Of countless peccadilloes in a jumble:<br />
Were I to catalogue each crime and lust,<br />
The medley of my sins might make you grumble:<br />
'Twould take from now till June to lay the dust,<br />
If in this mud heap we began to tumble;<br />
One only point I'd have you still perpend&#8212;<br />
I never in my life betrayed a friend.&quot;

There is a spirit, Astarotte height,<br />
Wise, terrible, and fierce exceedingly;<br />
In Hell's dark caves profound he hides from sight:<br />
No goblin, but a fiend far blacker he.&#8212;<br />
Malagigi summoned him one deep midnight,<br />

Said Astarotte: &quot;This point remains obscure,<br />
Unless I thought the whole night through thereon;<br />
Nor would my best of judgments be secure;&#8212;<br />
The paths of heaven for us are all undone,<br />
Our sight of things to be is no more sure<br />
Than that of sages gazing on the sun;<br />
For neither man nor beast would 'scape from Hell,<br />
Had not our wings been shortened when we fell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of the Old Testament I've much to teach,<br />
And of what happened in the days gone by;<br />
But all things do not come within our reach:<br />
One only Power there is, who sees on high,<br />
As in a glass before him, all and each,<br />
Past, present, and remote futurity:<br />
He who made all that is, alone knows all,<br />
Nor doth the Son well know what shall befall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Therefore I could not without thought intense<br />
Tell thee the destined fate of Charlemain:&#8212;<br />
Know that the air around us now is dense<br />
With spirits; in their hands I see them strain<br />
Astrolabe, almanac, and tablet, whence<br />
To read yon signs in heaven of strife and bane&#8212;<br />
The blood and treason, overthrow and war,<br />
Menaced by Mars in Scorpio angular.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for thy better understanding, he<br />
Is joined with Saturn in the ascendant, so<br />
Charged with all-powerful malignity<br />
That e'en the wars of Turnus had less woe.<br />
Slaughters of many peoples we shall see,<br />
With dire disasters in confusion flow,<br />
And change of states and mighty realms; for I<br />
Know that these signs were never wont to lie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">-551-</a></span><br />
<br />
&quot;I know not whether thou hast fixed thy thought<br />
Upon those comets which appeared of late,<br />
Veru and Dominus and Ascon, brought<br />
Treasons and wars and strife to indicate,<br />
With deaths of princes and great nobles fraught?<br />
These, too, ne'er falsified the word of fate.<br />
So that it seems from what I learn and see,<br />
That what I say, and worse, is like to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Gano with Marsilio planned before,<br />
I know not, since I did not think thereon:<br />
But he's the same, methinks, he was of yore;<br />
Wherefore this needs no divination:<br />
A seat is waiting for him at hell's core;<br />
And if his life's book I correctly con,<br />
That evil soul will very shortly go<br />
To weep his sins in everlasting woe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then spake Malagigi: &quot;Something thou hast said<br />
Which holds my sense and reason still in doubt,<br />
That some things even from the Son are hid;<br />
This thy dark saying I can fathom not.&quot;<br />
Then Astarotte: &quot;Thou, it seems, hast read<br />
But ill thy Bible, or its words forgot;<br />
For when the Son was asked of that great day,<br />
Only the Father knows, He then did say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark my words, Malagigi! Thou shalt hear,<br />
Now if thou wilt, the fiend's theology:<br />
Then to thy churchmen go, and make it clear.<br />
You say: Three Persons in one entity,<br />
One substance; and to this we, too, adhere:<br />
One flawless, pure, unmixed activity:&#8212;<br />
Wherefore it follows from what went before,<br />
That this alone is what you all adore.<br />
<br />
&quot;One mover, whence all movement is impelled:<br />
One order, whence all order hath its rise;<br />
One cause, whereby all causes are compelled;<br />
One power, whence flow all powers and energies;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">-552-</a></span><br />
One fire, wherein all radiances are held;<br />
One principle, which every truth implies;<br />
One knowledge, whence all wisdom hath been given;<br />
One Good, which made all good in earth and heaven.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is that Father and that ancient King,<br />
Who hath made all things and can all things know,<br />
But cannot change His own wise ordering,<br />
Else heaven and earth to ruin both would go.<br />
Having lost His friendship, I no more may wing<br />
My flight unto the mirror, where our woe<br />
Perchance e'en now is clearly shown to view;<br />
Albeit futurity I never knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;If Lucifer had known the doom to be,<br />
He had not brought those fruits of rashness forth;<br />
Nor had he ruined for eternity,<br />
Seeking his princely station in the North;<br />
But being impotent all things to see,<br />
He and we all were damned 'neath heaven and earth;<br />
And since he was the first to sin, he first<br />
Fell to Giudecca, and still fares the worst.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nor had we vainly tempted all the blest,<br />
Who now sit crowned with stars in Paradise,<br />
If, as I said, a veil by God's behest<br />
Had not been drawn before our mental eyes;<br />
Nor would that Saint, of Saints the first and best<br />
Been tempted, as your Gospel testifies,<br />
And borne by Satan to the pinnacle<br />
Where at the last he saw His miracle.<br />
<br />
&quot;And forasmuch as He makes nothing ill,<br />
And all hath circumscribed by fixed decrees,<br />
And what He made is present with Him still,<br />
Being established on just premises,<br />
Know that this Lord repents not of His will;<br />
Nay, if one saith that change hath been, he sees<br />
Falsehood for truth, in sense and judgment blind<br />
For what is now, was in the primal mind.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">-553-</a></span><br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me,&quot; then answered Malagigi, &quot;more,<br />
Since thou'rt an angel sage and rational!<br />
If that first Mover, whom we all adore,<br />
Within His secret soul foreknew your fell,<br />
If time and hour were both foreseen before,<br />
His sentence must be found tyrannical,<br />
Lacking both justice and true charity;<br />
Since, while creating, and while damning, He<br />
<br />
&quot;Foreknew you to be frail and formed in sin;<br />
Nathless you call Him just and piteous,<br />
Nor was there room, you say, pardon to win:&#8212;<br />
This makes our God the partisan of those<br />
Angels who stayed the gates of heaven within,<br />
Who knew the true from false, discerning thus<br />
Which side would prosper, which would lose the day,<br />
Nor went, like you, with Lucifer astray.&quot;<br />
<br />
Astarotte, like the devil, raged with pain;<br />
Then cried: &quot;That just Sabaoth loved no more<br />
Michael than Lucifer; nor made he Cain<br />
More apt than Abel to shed brother's gore:<br />
If one than Nimrod was more proud and vain,<br />
If the other, all unlike to Gabriel, swore<br />
He'd not repent nor bellow psalms to heaven,<br />
It was free-will condemned both unforgiven.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was the single cause that damned us all:<br />
His clemency, moreover, gave full time,<br />
Wherein 'twas granted us to shun the fall,<br />
And by repentance to compound our crime;<br />
But now we've fallen from grace beyond recall:<br />
Just was our sentence from that Judge sublime;<br />
His foresight shortened not our day of grace,<br />
For timely penitence aye finds a place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just is the Father, Son, and just the Word!<br />
His justice with great mercy was combined:<br />
Through pride no more than thanklessness we erred;<br />
That was our sin malignant and unkind:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">-554-</a></span><br />
Nor hath remorse our stubborn purpose stirred,<br />
Seeing that evil nourished in the mind<br />
And will of those who knew the good, and were<br />
Untempted, never yet was changed to fair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam knew not the nature of his sin;<br />
Therefore his primal error was forgiven,<br />
Because the tempter took him in a gin:<br />
Only his disobedience angered heaven;<br />
Therefore, though cast from Eden, he might win<br />
Grace, when repentance from his heart had driven<br />
The wicked will, with peace to end his strife,<br />
And mercy also in eternal life.<br />
<br />
&quot;But the angelic nature, once debased,<br />
Can never more to purity return:<br />
It sinned with science and corrupted taste:<br />
Whence in despair incurable we burn.<br />
Now, if that wise one answered not, nor raised<br />
His voice, when Pilate asked of him to learn<br />
What was the truth, the truth was at his side;<br />
This ignorance was therefore justified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pilate was lost, because in doing well<br />
He persevered not when he washed his hand;<br />
And Judas, too, beyond redemption fell,<br />
Because, though penitent at last, he banned<br />
Hope, without which no soul escapes from hell:<br />
His doom no Origen shall countermand,<br />
Nor who to Judas give what's meant for Judah&#8212;<br />
<i>In diebus illis salvabitur Juda.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Thus there is one first Power in heaven who knew<br />
All things, by whom all things were also made:<br />
Making and damning us, He still was true;<br />
On Truth and Justice all His work is laid:<br />
Future and past are present to his view;<br />
For it must follow, as I elsewhere said,<br />
That the whole world before His face should lie,<br />
From whom proceeds force, virtue, energy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">-555-</a></span><br />
<br />
&quot;But now that thou hast bound me to relate,<br />
My master thou, the cause of our mischance,<br />
Thou fain would'st hear why He who rules o'er fate,<br />
And of our fall foresaw each circumstance,<br />
Labored in vain, and made us reprobate?&#8212;<br />
Sealed is that rubric, closed from every glance,<br />
Reserved for Him, the Lord victorious:<br />
I know not, I can only answer thus!<br />
<br />
&quot;Nor speak I this to put thy mind to proof;<br />
But forasmuch as I discern that men<br />
Weave on this warp of doubts a misty woof,<br />
Seeking to learn; albeit they cannot ken<br />
Whence flows the Nile&#8212;the Danube's not enough!<br />
Assure thy soul, nor ask the how and when,<br />
That heaven's high Master, as the Psalmist taught,<br />
Is just and true in all that he hath wrought.<br />
<br />
&quot;The things whereof I speak are known not by<br />
Poet or prophet, moralist or sage:<br />
Yet mortal men in their presumption try<br />
To rank the hierarchies, stage over stage!<br />
A chieftain among Seraphim was I;<br />
Yet knew not what in many a learn&#233;d page<br />
Denys and Gregory wrote!&#8212;Full surely they<br />
Who paint heaven after earth will go astray!<br />
<br />
&quot;But above all things see thou art not led<br />
By elves and wandering sprites, a tricksy kind,<br />
Who never speak one word of truth, but shed<br />
Doubt and suspicion on the hearer's mind;<br />
Their aim is injury toward fools ill-sped:<br />
And, mark this well, they ne'er have been confined<br />
To glass or water, but reside in air,<br />
Playing their pranks here, there, and everywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;From ear to ear they pass, and 'tis their vaunt<br />
Ever to make things seem that are not so:<br />
For one delights in horseplay, jeer and jaunt;<br />
One deals in science; one pretends to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">-556-</a></span><br />
Where treasures lurk in some forgotten haunt:<br />
Others, more grave, futurity foreknow:&#8212;<br />
But now I've given thee hints enough, to tell<br />
That courtesy can even be found in Hell!&quot;

And when Rinaldo had learned all his need,<br />
&quot;Astarotte,&quot; he cried, &quot;thou art a perfect friend,<br />

This I say truly: if God's will should bend,<br />
If grace divine should e'er so much concede<br />
As to reverse heaven's ordinance, amend<br />
Its statutes, sentences, or high decrees,<br />
I will remember these thy services.<br />

Yet shall those keys be lost for us for ever:<br />
High treason was our crime, measureless ill.<br />
Thrice happy Christians! One small tear can sever<br />
<i>Your</i> bonds!&#8212;One sigh, sent from the contrite will:<br />
Lord, to Thee only did I sin!&#8212;But never<br />
Shall <i>we</i> find grace: we sinned once; now we lie<br />
Sentenced to hell for all eternity.<br />
<br />
&quot;If after, say, some thousand million ages<br />
We might have hope yet once to see again<br />
The least spark of that Love, this pang that rages<br />
Here at the core, could scarce be reckoned pain!&#8212;<br />
But wherefore annotate such dreary pages?<br />
To wish for what can never be, is vain.<br />

I ask not for that wreath of bay or laurel<br />
Which on Greek brows or Roman proudly shone:<br />
With this plain quill and style I do not quarrel,<br />
Nor have I sought to sing of Helicon:<br />
My Pegasus is but a rustic sorrel;<br />
Untutored mid the graves I still pipe on:<br />
Leave me to chat with Corydon and Thyrsis;<br />
I'm no good shepherd, and can't mend my verses.<br />
<br />
Indeed I'm not a rash intrusive claimant,<br />
Like the mad piper of those ancient days,<br />
From whom Apollo stripped his living raiment,<br />
Nor quite the Satyr that my face bewrays.<br />
A nobler bard shall rise and win the payment<br />
Fame showers on loftier style and worthier lays:<br />
While I mid beech-woods and plain herdsmen dwell,<br />
Who love the rural muse of Pulci well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">-560-</a></span><br />
<br />
I'll tempt the waters in my little wherry,<br />
Seeking safe shallows where a skiff may swim:<br />
My only care is how to make men merry<br />
With these thick-crowding thoughts that take my whim:<br />
'Tis right that all things in this world should vary;&#8212;<br />
Various are wits and faces, stout and slim,<br />
One dotes on white, while one dubs black sublime,<br />
And subjects vary both in prose and rhyme.

Sicilian, it may be said in passing, presents close dialectical
resemblance to Tuscan. Even the superficial alteration of the Sicilian
<i>u</i> and <i>i</i> into the Tuscan <i>o</i> and <i>e</i> (<i>e.g.</i> <i>secundu</i> and <i>putiri</i>
into <i>secondo</i> and <i>potere</i>) effaces the most obvious differences.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> The Italians wavered long between several metrical
systems, before they finally adopted the hendecasyllabic line, which
became the consecrated rhythm of serious poetry. Carducci, in his
treatise <i>Intorno ad alcune Rime</i> (Imola, Galeati, 1876), pp. 81-89, may
be profitably consulted with regard to early Italian Alexandrines. He
points out that Ciullo's <i>Tenzone</i>:</p>

<p class="center">Rosa fresc' aulentissima&#8212;c'appar' in ver' l'estate:</p>

<p>and the Ballata of the Comari:</p>

<p class="center">Pur bi' del vin, comadr'&#8212;e no lo temperare:</p>

<p>together with numerous compositions of the Northern Lombard school
(Milan and Verona), are written in Alexandrines. In the
Lombardo-Sicilian age of Italian literature, before Bologna acted as an
intermediate to Florence, this meter bid fair to become acclimatized.
But the Tuscan genius determined decisively for the hendecasyllabic.</p></div>

<p>so ungently handled by Dante in the <i>Inferno</i>, Canto xxix. I am aware
that grave doubts, based upon historical allusions in Folgore's
miscellaneous sonnets, have been raised as to whether we can assign so
early a date to Folgore, and whether his Brigata was really the <i>brigata
godereccia, spendereccia</i>, of Siena alluded to by Dante. See Bartoli,
<i>Storia della Letteratura Italiana</i>, vol. ii. cap. II, for a discussion
of these points. See also Giulio Navone's edition of Folgore's and
Cene's <i>Rime</i>, Bologna, Romagnoli, 1880. This editor argues forcibly for
a later date&#8212;not earlier at all events than from 1300 to 1320. But,
whether we choose the earlier date 1260 or the later 1315, Folgore may
legitimately be used for my present purpose of illustration.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> This is equally true of Cene dalla Chitarra's satirical
parodies of the Months, in which, using the same rhymes as Folgore, he
turns each of his motives to ridicule. Cene was a poet of Arezzo. His
series and Folgore's will both be found in the <i>Poeti del Primo Secolo</i>,
vol. ii., and in Navone's edition cited above.</p></div>

unfinished set of five sonnets (Navone's edition, pp. 45-49), which are
composed in a somewhat different key. They describe the arming of a
young knight, and his reception by Valor, Humility, Discretion, and
Gladness. Yet the knight, so armed and accepted, is no Galahad, far less
the grim horseman of D&#252;rer's allegory. Like the members of the <i>brigata
godereccia</i>, he is rather a Gawain or Astolfo, all love, fine clothes,
and courtship. Each of these five sonnets is a precious little miniature
of Italian carpet-chivalry. The quaintest is the second, which begins:</p>

<p>This exordium makes one regret that the painter of the young knight in
our National Gallery (Giorgione?) had not essayed a companion picture.
Valor disrobing him and taking him into her arms and crying <i>Queste

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_60_60" id="Footnote_60_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> If I were writing the history of early Tuscan poetry, I
should wish here to compare the rarely beautiful poem of Lapo Gianni,
<i>Amor eo chero</i>, with Folgore, and the masterly sonnets of Cecco
Angiolieri of Siena, especially the one beginning <i>S'io fossi fuoco</i>,
with Cene dalla Chitarra, in order to prove the fullness of sensuous and
satirical inspiration in the age preceding Dante. Lapo wishes he had the
beauty of Absalom, the strength of Samson; that the Arno would run balm
for him, her walls be turned to silver and her paving-stones to crystal;
that he might abide in eternal summer gardens among thousands of the
loveliest women, listening to the songs of birds and instruments of
music. The voluptuousness of Folgore is here heightened to ecstasy.
Cecco desires to be fire, wind, sea, God, that he might ruin the world;
the emperor, that he might decapitate its population; death, that he
might seek out his father and mother; life, that he might fly from both;
being Cecco, he would fain take all fair women, and leave the foul to
his neighbors. The spite of Cene is deepened to insanity.</p></div>

scorn. He resented it, as appears from a letter to Zanobi della Strada
(<i>Op. Volg.</i> vol. xvii. p. 101), because it implied a love of Court
delights and parasitical idleness. In that letter he amply defends
himself from such imputations, showing that he led the life of a poor
and contented student. Yet the nickname was true in a deeper sense, as
is proved by the very arguments of his apology, and confirmed by the
description of his life at Certaldo remote from civic duties (Letter to
Pino de' Rossi, <i>ibid.</i> p. 35), as well as by the tragi-comic narrative
of his discomfort at Naples (Letter to Messer Francesco, <i>ibid.</i> pp.
37-87). Not only in these passages, but in all his works he paints
himself a comfort-loving <i>bourgeois</i>, whose heart was set on his books,
whose ideal of enjoyment was a satisfied passion of a sensual kind.</p></div>

the <i>Filostrato</i>, the <i>Ninfale Fiesolano</i>, the <i>Amorosa Visione</i>, he
sings the hymn of <i>Il Talento</i>, triumphant over medieval discipline.
They form the proper prelude to what is sometimes called the Paganism of

was this <i>talento</i> which Valla philosophized, and Beccadelli and Pontano

methods of Boccaccio and Dante in dealing with the same material. We all
know in what murk and filth Dante beheld Ciacco, the glutton, and what
torments awaited Filippo Argenti, the <i>fiorentino spirito bizzarro</i>,
upon the marsh of Styx (<i>Inferno</i> vi. and viii.). These persons play the
chief parts in Giorn. ix. nov. 8, of the <i>Decameron</i>. They are still the
spendthrift parasite, and the brutally capricious bully. But while Dante
points the sternest moral by their examples, Boccaccio makes their vices
serve his end of comic humor. The inexorableness of Dante is nowhere
more dreadful than in the eighth Canto of the <i>Inferno</i>. The levity of
Boccaccio is nowhere more superficial than in that Novella.</p></div>

noticed. Many other curious satires, notably one against marriage and
the female sex, can also be found in Du M&#233;ril's three great collections,

an excellent selection of the serious and jocular popular Latin medieval
poetry in a little volume <i>Gaudeamus! Carmina Vagorum selecta</i>, Lipsi&#230;,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_93_93" id="Footnote_93_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_93_93"><span class="label">[93]</span></a> The erotic and drinking songs of the Vagi deserve to be
carefully studied by all who wish to understand the germs of the
Renaissance in the middle ages. They express a simple naturalism, not of
necessity Pagan, though much is borrowed from the language of classical
mythology. I would call attention in particular to <i>&#198;stuans interius</i>,
<i>Omittamus studia</i>, <i>O admirabile Veneris idolum</i>, <i>Ludo cum C&#230;cilia</i>,
<i>Si puer cum puellula</i>, and four <i>Pastoralia</i>, all of which may be found
in the little book <i>Gaudeamus</i> cited above. In spontaneity and truth of
feeling they correspond to the Latin hymns. But their spirit is the
exact antithesis of that which produced the <i>Dies Ir&#230;</i> and the <i>Stabat
Mater</i>. The absence of erudition and classical imitation separates them
from the poems of Beccadelli, Pontano, Poliziano, or Bembo. They present
the natural material of neo-pagan Latin verse without its imitative
form. It is youth rejoicing in its strength and lustihood, enjoying the
delights of spring, laughing at death, taking the pleasures of the
moment, deriding the <i>rumores senum severiorum</i>, unmasking hypocrisy in
high places, at wanton war with constituted social shams. These songs
were written by wandering students of all nations, who traversed
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, England, seeking special knowledge at the
great centers of learning, following love-adventures, poor and careless,
coldly greeted by the feudal nobility and the clergy, attached to the
people by their habits but separated from them by their science. In
point of faith these poets are orthodox. There is no questioning of
ecclesiastical dogma, no anticipation of Luther, in their verses. This
blending of theological conformity with satire on the Church and moral
laxity is eminently characteristic of the Renaissance in Italy.</p></div>

&quot;With ears intent upon the music, he began to go in the direction whence
he heard it; and when he drew nigh to the fountain, he beheld the two
maidens. They were of countenance exceeding white, and this whiteness
was blent in seemly wise with ruddy hues. Their eyes seemed to be stars
of morning, and their little mouths, of the color of a vermeil rose,
became of pleasanter aspect as they moved them to the music of their
song. Their tresses, like threads of gold, were very fair, and slightly
curled went wandering through the green leaves of their garlands. By
reason of the great heat their tender and delicate limbs, as hath been
saaid above, were clad in robes of the thinnest texture, the which, made
very tight above the waist, revealed the form of their fair bosoms,
which like two round apples pushed the opposing raiment outward, and
therewith in divers places the white flesh appeared through graceful
openings. Their stature was of fitting size, and each limb
well-proportioned.&quot;</p></div>

idyllic landscape; but he had not the pictorial faculty in a wider
sense. The frescoes of the <i>Amorosa Visione</i>, when compared with
Poliziano's descriptions in <i>La Giostra</i>, are but meager notes of form.
Possibly the progress of the arts from Giotto to Benozzo Gozzoli and
Botticelli may explain this picturesque inferiority of the elder poet;
but in reading Boccaccio we feel that the defect lay not so much in his
artistic faculty as in the limitation of his sympathy to certain kinds
of beauty.</p></div>

Fiammetta was the natural daughter of Petrarch's friend and patron, King
Robert. Boccaccio first saw her in the church of S. Lawrence at Naples,
April 7, 1341.</p></div>

been traced by Du M&#233;ril in his edition of the thirteenth-century French
version (Paris, 1856). He is of opinion that Boccaccio may have derived
it from some Byzantine source. But this seems hardly probable, since
Boccaccio gained his knowledge of Greek later in life. Certain
indications in the <i>Filocopo</i> point to a Spanish original.</p></div>

her promise at the end of the <i>Caccia di Diana</i>, canto xvii. (<i>Op.

Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio severally with the religious, chivalrous

midway. With Dante he shares the chivalrous, with Boccaccio the
humanistic side of the national element. Though Boccaccio anticipates in
his work the literature of the Renaissance, yet Petrarch was certainly
not less influential as an authority in style. Ariosto represents the
fusion of both sections of the national element in literature&#8212;Italian

A knight kills a licentious friar&#8212;&quot;alquanto pentito per avere le sue

p. 13). It emerges in his description of the Order of the Ermine
(<i>ibid.</i> p. 240). It is curious to compare this with his strong censure
of the point of honor (pp. 388, 389) in a story which has the same blunt
sense as Ariosto's episode of Giocondo. The Italian here prevails over
the noble.</p></div>

sermone annum ante trigesimum &#230;tatis su&#230; etruscos libros, primum,
secundum, ac tertium de Familia, quos Rom&#230; die nonagesimo quam
incho&#226;rat, absolvit; sed inelimatos et asperos neque usquequaquam
etruscos ... post annos tres, quam primos ediderat, quartum librum
ingratis protulit&quot; (<i>op. cit.</i> i. xciv. c.). It appears from a reference
in Book ii. (<i>op. cit.</i> ii. xxviii.) that the Treatise was still in
process of composition after 1438; and there are strong reasons for
believing that Book iii., as it is now numbered, was written separately
and after the rest of the dialogue.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_224_224" id="Footnote_224_224"></a><a href="#FNanchor_224_224"><span class="label">[224]</span></a> Note especially the passage in Book iii., <i>op. cit.</i> ii.

of the anonymous biographer, who says this Treatise was written before
Alberti's thirtieth year; and if he returned to Florence in 1434, we
must take the date of his birth about 1404. The scene of the
<i>Tranquillit&#224; dell'Animo</i> is laid in the Duomo at Florence; we may
therefore believe it to have been a later work, and its allusions to the
<i>Famiglia</i> are, in my opinion, trustworthy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_226_226" id="Footnote_226_226"></a><a href="#FNanchor_226_226"><span class="label">[226]</span></a> The pedigree prefixed to the Dialogue in Bonucci's
edition would help the student in his task. I will here cite the
principal passages of importance I have noticed. In volume ii. p. 102,
we find a list of the Alberti remarkable for literary, scientific,
artistic, and ecclesiastical distinctions. On p. 124 we read of their
dispersion over the Levant, Greece, Spain, France, England, Belgium,
Germany, and the chief Italian towns. Their misfortunes in exile are
touchingly alluded to with a sobriety of phrase that dignifies the grief
it veils, in the noble passage beginning with p. 256. Their ancient
splendor in the tournaments and games of Florence, when the people
seemed to have eyes only for men of the Alberti blood, is described on
p. 228; their palaces and country houses on p. 279. A list of the
knights, generals, and great lawyers of the Casa Alberti is given at p.
346. The honesty of their commercial dealings and their reputation for
probity form the themes of a valuable digression, pp. 204-206, where we
learn the extent of their trade and the magnitude of their contributions
to the State-expenses. On p. 210 there is a statement that this house
alone imported from Flanders enough wool to supply the cloth-trade, not
only of Florence, but also of the larger part of Tuscany. The losses of
a great commercial family are reckoned on p. 357; while p. 400 supplies
the story of one vast loan of 80,000 golden florins advanced by
Ricciardo degli Alberti to Pope John. The friendship of Piero degli
Alberti contracted with Filippo Maria Visconti and King Ladislaus of
Naples is described in the autobiographical discourse introduced at pp.
386-399. This episode is very precious for explaining the relation
between Italian princes and the merchants who resided at their courts.
Their servant Buto, p. 375, should not be omitted from the picture; nor
should the autobiographical narrative given by Giannozzo of his relation
to his wife (pp. 320-328) be neglected, since this carries us into the
very center of a Florentine home. The moral tone, the political feeling,
and the domestic habits of the house in general must be studied in the
description of the Casa, Bottega, and Villa, the discourses on
education, and the discussion of public and domestic duties. The
commercial aristocracy of Florence lives before us in this Treatise. We
learn from it to know exactly what the men who sustained the liberties
of Italy against the tyrants of Milan thought and felt, at a period of
history when the old fabric of medieval ideas had broken down, but when
the new Italy of the Renaissance had not yet been fully formed. If, in
addition to the <i>Trattato della Famiglia</i>, the letters addressed by
Alessandra Macinghi degli Strozzi to her children in exile be included
in such a study, a vivid picture might be formed of the domestic life of
a Florentine family.<a name="FNanchor_A_227" id="FNanchor_A_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_227" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> These letters were written from Florence to sons
of the Casa Strozzi at Naples, Bruges, and elsewhere between the years
1447 and 1465. They contain minute information about expenditure,
taxation, dress, marriages, friendships, and all the public and personal
relations of a noble Florentine family. Much, moreover, can be gathered
from them concerning the footing of the members of the circle in exile.
The private <i>ricordi</i> of heads of families, portions of which have been
already published from the archives of the Medici and Strozzi, if more
fully investigated, would complete this interesting picture in many of
its important details.</p></div>

such literary plagiarism was both more common and less disgraceful in
the fifteenth century. Alberti himself incorporated passages of the
<i>Fiammetta</i> in his <i>Deifira</i>, and Jacopo Nardi in his <i>Storia
Fiorentina</i> appropriated the whole of Buonaccorsi's Diaries (1498-1512)

meager. The MSS. of the <i>Governo</i> in particular do not seem to have been

knew Greek is not ascertained; but even in the bad Latin translations of
that age a flavor so peculiar as that of Xenophon's style could not have

micanti e ludibondi. Forme prae-excellente, Habiti incentivi, Moventie
puellare, Risguardi mordenti, Exornato mundissimo. Niuna parte simulata,
ma tutto dalla natura perfecto, cum exquisita politione, Niente difforme
ma tutto harmonia concinnissima, Capi flavi cum le trece biondissime e
crini insolari tante erano bellissime complicate, cum cordicelle, o vero
nextruli di seta e di fili doro intorte, quanto che in tutto la
operatione humana excedevano, circa la testa cum egregio componimento
invilupate e cum achi crinali detente, e la fronte di cincinni capreoli
silvata, cum lascivula inconstantia praependenti.&quot; There is an obvious
study of Boccaccesque phrase, with a no less obvious desire to improve
upon its exquisiteness of detail, masking an incapacity to write

illirici e greci</i>, Venezia, 1841. (2) Tigri, <i>Canti popolari toscani</i>,
Firenze, 1869. (3) Pitr&#233;, <i>Canti popolari siciliani</i>, and <i>Studi di
poesia popolare</i>, Palermo, 1870-1872. (4) D'Ancona, <i>La Poesia popolare
italiana</i>, Livorno, 1878. (5) Rubieri, <i>Storia della poesia popolare
italiana</i>, Firenze, 1877. Also numerous collections of local songs, of
which a good list is furnished in D'Ancona's work just cited. Bolza's
edition of Comasque poetry, Dal Medico's of Venetian, Ferraro's of
<i>Canti Monferrini</i> (district of Montferrat), Vigo's of Sicilian,
together with Imbriani's of Southern and Marcoaldo's of Central
dialects, deserve to be specially cited. The literature in question is
already voluminous, and bids fair to receive considerable additions.</p></div>

Poliziano's Canzonet, <i>La pastorella si leva per tempo</i>, is a
<i>pasticcio</i> composed of fragments from popular songs in vogue at his
day. We possess three valuable poems&#8212;one by Bronzino, published in
1567; one by Il Cieco Bianchino of Florence, published at Verona in
1629; the third by Il Cieco Britti of Venice, published in the same
year&#8212;which consist of extracts from popular lyrics united together by
the rhymster. Hence their name <i>incatenatura</i>. See Rubieri, <i>op. cit.</i>
pp. 121, 130, 212. See, too, D'Ancona, <i>op. cit.</i> pp. 100-105, 146-172,

fraternities, preserved in the Pinacoteca of that town, are interesting
for their illustration of these religious companies at a later date. The
Gonfalone of S. Bernardino by Bonfigli represents the saint between
heaven and earth pleading for his votaries. Their Oratory (Cappella di
Giustizia) is seen behind, and in front are the men and women of the
order. That of the <i>Societas Annuntiat&#230;</i> with date 1466, shows a like
band of lay brethren and sisters. That of the Giustizia by Perugino has
a similar group, kneeling and looking up to Madonna, who is adored by S.
Francis and S. Bernardino in the heavens. Behind is a landscape with a
portion of Perugia near the Church of S. Francis. The Stendardo of the
Confraternit&#224; di S. Agostino by Pinturicchio exhibits three
white-clothed members of the body, kneeling and gazing up to their
patron. There is also a fine picture in the Perugian Pinacoteca by Giov.
Boccati of Camerino (signed and dated 1447) representing Madonna
enthroned in a kind of garden, surrounded by child-like angels with
beautiful blonde hair, singing and reading from choir books in a double
row of semi-circular choir-stalls. Below, S. Francis and S. Dominic are
leading each two white <i>Disciplinati</i> to the throne. These penitents
carry their scourges, and holes cut in the backs of their monastic
cloaks show the skin red with stripes. One on either side has his face
uncovered: the other wears the hood down, with eye-holes pierced in it.
This picture belonged to the Confraternity of S. Domenico.</p></div>

Venetia, appresso Niccol&#242; Miserrimi, MDCXVII. The book is a thick 4to,
consisting of 1,055 pages, closely printed. It contains a voluminous
running commentary. The editor, Tresatti, a Minorite Friar, says he had
extracted 211 <i>Cantici</i> of Jacopone from MSS. belonging to his Order,
whereas the Roman and Florentine editions, taken together, contained 102
in all. He divides them into seven sections: (1) Satires, (2) Moral
Songs, (3) Odes, (4) Penitential Hymns, (5) The Theory of Divine Love,
(6) Spiritual Love Poems, (7) Spiritual Secrets. This division
corresponds to seven stages in the soul's progress toward perfection.
The arrangement is excellent, though the sections in some places
interpenetrate. For variety of subjects, the collection is a kind of
lyrical encyclop&#230;dia, touching all needs and states of the devout soul.
It might supply material for meditation through a lifetime to a heart in
harmony with its ascetic and erotically enthusiastic tone.</p></div>

rhythm, in which great licenses of extra syllables are allowed. The
stanza rhymes <i>a b a b c c</i>. The <i>sesta rima</i> of the transition has the
same rhyming structure. The <i>Corrotto</i> by Jacopone da Todi, analyzed
above, shows a similar system of rhymes to that of some Latin hymns: <i>a
a a b c c c b</i>, the <i>b</i> rhyme in <i>ato</i> being carried through the whole

arts in the fifteenth century is apparent when we contrast the
<i>Rappresentazioni</i> with Masaccio's, Ghirlandajo's, Mantegna's, or
Carpaccio's paintings. Art, as I have frequently had to observe,
emancipated the human faculties, and humanized the figments of the
middle age by investing them with corporeal shape and forms of &#230;sthetic
beauty. The deliverance of the Italian genius was thus effected in
painting earlier than in poetry, and in those very spheres of religious
art where the poets were helpless to attain true freedom. Italian poetry
first became free when it turned round and regarded the myths with an
amused smile. I do not say that this was absolutely necessary, that an
heroic Christian poetry might not have been produced in the fifteenth
century by another race. But for the Italians it was necessary.</p></div>

vol. iii. 88), writes of Lorenzo: &quot;Fu libidinoso, e tutto venereo e
constante negli amori suoi, che duravano parecchi anni; la quale cosa, a
giudicio di molti, gli indebol&#236; tanto il corpo, che lo fece morire, si
pu&#242; dire, giovane.&quot; Then, after describing his night-adventures outside
Florence, he proceeds: &quot;Cosa pazza a considerare che uno di tanta
grandezza, riputazione e prudenza, di et&#224; di anni quaranta, fussi s&#236;
preso di una dama non bella e gi&#224; piena di anni, che si conducessi a
fare cose, che sarebbono state disoneste a ogni fanciullo.&quot;</p></div>

No place or date or printer's name; but probably issued in the lifetime
of Lorenzo from Mongiani's press. There is a similar woodcut on the
title-page of the <i>Canzone a Ballo</i>, Firenze, 1568. It represents the
angle of the Medicean Palace in the Via Larga, girls dancing in a ring
upon the street, one with a wreath and thyrsus kneeling, another
presenting Lorenzo with a book.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_492_493" id="Footnote_492_493"></a><a href="#FNanchor_492_493"><span class="label">[492]</span></a> This poem must have been written between 1476, the date
of Simonetta's death, and 1478, the date of Giuliano's murder, when
Poliziano was about twenty-four. Chronology prevents us from regarding
it as the work of a boy of fourteen, as Roscoe thought, or of sixteen,
as Hallam concluded.</p></div>

translation of the <i>Iliad</i> in order to begin this poem in Italian. He
never took it up again. It remains a noble torso, the most splendid
extant version of a Greek poem in Latin by a modern hand.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_495_496" id="Footnote_495_496"></a><a href="#FNanchor_495_496"><span class="label">[495]</span></a> By a strange coincidence this was the anniversary of his
love, Simonetta's, death in 1476. The close connection between her
untimely end&#8212;celebrated by Lorenzo de' Medici in his earlier <i>Rime</i>, by
Poliziano in his Latin Elegy and again in the <i>Giostra</i>&#8212;and the
renascence of Italian poetry, makes her portrait by Botticelli della
Francesca in the Pitti interesting.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_496_497" id="Footnote_496_497"></a><a href="#FNanchor_496_497"><span class="label">[496]</span></a> I must refer my readers to the original, and to the
translations published by me in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/18893"><i>Sketches and Studies in Italy</i></a>, pp.
217-224. The description of Simonetta in the meadow (<i>Giostra</i>, i. 43
and following) might be compared to a Florentine Idyll by Benozzo
Gozzoli; the birth of Venus from the waves (i. 99-107) is a blending of
Botticelli's <i>Venus</i> in the Uffizzi with his <i>Primavera</i> in the Belle
Arti; the picture of Venus in the lap of Mars (i. 122-124) might be
compared to work by Piero di Cosimo, or, since poetry embraces many
suggestions, to paintings from the schools of Venice. The metamorphoses
of Jupiter (i. 104-107) remind us of Giulio Romano. The episode of
Ariadne and the Bacchic revel (i. 110-112) is in the style of Mantegna's
engravings. All these passages will be found translated by me in the
book above quoted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_497_498" id="Footnote_497_498"></a><a href="#FNanchor_497_498"><span class="label">[497]</span></a> I believe the <i>Favola di Orfeo</i>, first published in 1494,
and republished from time to time up to the year 1776, was the original
play acted at Mantua before the Cardinal Gonzaga. It is not divided into
acts, and has the usual &quot;Annunziatore della Festa,&quot; of the <i>Sacre
Rappresentazioni</i>. The <i>Orphei Trag&#230;dia</i>, published by the Padre Ireneo
Aff&#242; at Venice in 1776, from two MSS. collated by him, may be regarded
as a subsequent recension of his own work made by Poliziano. It is
divided into five acts, and is far richer in lyrical passages. Carducci
prints both in his excellent edition of Poliziano's Italian poems. I may
refer English readers to my own translation of the <i>Orfeo</i> and the note
upon its text, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/18893"><i>Studies and Sketches in Italy</i></a>, pp. 226-242, 429, 430.</p></div>

frequency of their editions. The <i>Orfeo</i> and the <i>Stanze</i> were printed
together or separately twenty-two times between 1494 and 1541, thirteen
times between 1541 and 1653. A redaction of the <i>Orfeo</i> in octave
stanzas was published at Florence in 1558 for the use of the common
people. It was entitled <i>La Historia e Favola d'Orfeo alla dolce lira</i>.
This narrative version of Poliziano's play is still reprinted from time
to time for the Tuscan <i>contadini</i>. Carducci cites an edition of Prato,
1860.</p></div>

Chrysocomus, or who knows the scandal falsely circulated regarding his

Orpheus (Carducci, pp. 109-110) with the personality of the

applause before a Cardinal, is a fact of much significance.</p></div>

letter of his to Lorenzo de' Medici we read: &quot;Nutris domi Homericum
ilium adolescentem Angelum Politianum qui Gr&#230;cam Homeri personam Latinis
coloribus exprimat. Exprimit jam; atque, id quod mirum est ita tener&#226;

dubitaturus sit e duobus uter naturalis sit et uter pictus Homerus&quot;
(<i>Ep.</i> ed. Flor. 1494, lib. i. p. 6). Ficino always addressed Poliziano
as &quot;Poeta Homericus.&quot;</p></div>

<i>tondo</i> in monochrome, representing Orpheus before the throne of Pluto.
He is dressed like a poet, with a laurel crown, and he is playing on a

Eurydice. It would be curious to know whether a rumor of the Mantuan
pageant had reached the ears of the Cortonese painter, or whether he had
read the edition of 1494.</p></div>

Pulci undertook (it is said, for fun) to heap scandals on each other's
heads, ransacking the language of the people for its vilest terms of
invective. If they began in joke, they ended in earnest; and Lorenzo de'
Medici, who had a taste for buffoonery, enjoyed the scuffle of his

the <i>spiriti folletti</i> deserves to be noticed. The latter were light and
tricksy spirits, on whom not even a magician could depend. Marsilio sent
two of them in a magic mirror to Charlemagne (xxv. 92), and Astarotte
warned Malagigi expressly against their vanity (xxv. 160, 161). Fairies,
<i>feux follets</i>, and the lying spirits of modern spiritualists seem to be
of this family. Translations from Astarotte's dialogue will be found in

physical geography are so learned that this part of the <i>Morgante</i> was
by Tasso ascribed to Ficino. It is not improbable that Pulci derived
some of the ideas from Ficino, but the style is entirely his own. The
sonnets he exchanged with Franco prove, moreover, that he was familiar
with the treatment of grave themes in a burlesque style. In
acknowledging the help of Poliziano he is quite frank (xxv. 115-117,
169; xxviii. 138-149). What that help exactly was, we do not know. But
there is nothing whatever to justify the tradition that Poliziano was
the real author of the <i>Morgante</i>. Probably he directed Pulci's reading;
and I think it not impossible, judging by one line in Canto xxv. (stanza
115, line 4), that he directed Pulci's attention to the second of the
two poems out of which the narrative was wrought. If we were to ascribe
all the passages in the <i>Morgante</i> that display curious knowledge to
Pulci's friends, we might claim the discourse on the antipodes for
Toscanelli and the debates on the angelic nature for Palmieri. Such
criticism is, however, far-fetched and laboriously hypothetical. Pulci
lived in an intellectual atmosphere highly charged with speculation of
all kinds, and his poem reflected the opinion of his age. His own
methods of composition and the relation in which he stood to other poets
of the age are explained in two passages of the <i>Morgante</i> (xxv. 117,
xxviii. 138-149), where he disclaims all share of humanistic erudition,
and expresses his indifference to the solemn academies of the learned.

that the <i>Orlando Innamorato</i> contains a vein of conscious humor. See
<i>Le Fonti</i>, etc., pp. 24-27. I agree with him that Boiardo treated his
subject playfully. But it must be remembered that he was far from
wishing to indulge a secret sarcasm like Ariosto, or to make open fun of

<i>Mambriano</i> owes all its interest to the episodes, and many of its
introductory reflections are fair specimens of the discursive style. But
the peculiarity of Boiardo, as followed by Ariosto, consisted in the art
of subordinating these subsidiary motives to the main design. Neither
Pulci nor Bello showed any true sense of poetical unity. It may here be
parenthetically remarked that Francesco Bello, a native of Ferrara,
called Il Cieco because of his blindness, recited his <i>Mambriano</i> at the
Mantuan Court of the Gonzagas. It was not printed till after his death
in 1509. This poem consists of a series of tales, loosely stitched
together, each canto containing just enough to stimulate the attention
of an idle audience. Rinaldo, Astolfo, and Mambriano, king of Bithynia,
play prominent parts in the action.</p></div>

eloquent defense of these Horatian verses in his essay, <i>Delle Poesie
Latine di L. Ariosto</i> (Bologna, Zanichelli, 1876), p. 82. The latter
treatise is a learned criticism of Ariosto's Latin poetry from a point
of view somewhat too indulgent to Ariosto as a poet and a man. Carducci,
for example, calls the four Alcaic stanzas in question &quot;una cosellina
quasi perfetta,&quot; though they contain three third lines like these:</p>

Furore militis tremendo....<br />
Jacentem aqu&#230; ad murmur cadentis....<br />

</table>

<p>Ariosto was but second-rate among the Latin versifiers of his century.
It must, however, be added that his Latin poems were written in early
manhood and only published after his death by Giambattista Pigna, in
1553.</p></div>

<p>What Ariosto thought about the Italian despots finds full expression in
the <i>Cinque Canti</i>, ii. 5, 6, where he protests that Caligula, Nero,
Phalaris, Dionysius and Creon were surpassed by them in cruelty and
crime.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_616_617" id="Footnote_616_617"></a><a href="#FNanchor_616_617"><span class="label">[616]</span></a> I have followed the order of Lemonnier's edition, vol. i.
of <i>Opere Minori</i>, Florence, 1857. But the dates of composition are
uncertain, and it may be doubted whether Ariosto's own autograph can be
taken as the basis of a chronological arrangement. Much obscurity rests
upon these poems. We do not know, for instance, whether they were sent
to the friends addressed in them by name, or whether the author intended
them for publication. The student may profitably consult upon these
points the lithographed facsimile of the autograph, published at Bologna
by Zanichelli in 1875. Meanwhile it is enough to mention that the first
epistle was addressed to Messer Galasso Ariosto, the poet's brother, the
second to Messer Alessandro Ariosto and Messer Lodovico da Bagno, the
third and fourth to Messer Annibale Maleguccio, the fifth to Messer
Sismondo Maleguccio, the sixth to Messer Buonaventura Pistofilo, and the
seventh to Monsignore Pietro Bembo.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_617_618" id="Footnote_617_618"></a><a href="#FNanchor_617_618"><span class="label">[617]</span></a> The first and second <i>Capitoli</i>, upon the irksome and
exhausting service of the Cardinal, as dangerous to Ariosto's health as
it was irritating to his temper, should be read side by side with this
Epistle.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_618_619" id="Footnote_618_619"></a><a href="#FNanchor_618_619"><span class="label">[618]</span></a> See above,

ate them with vinegar and wine sauce.</p></div>

autograph. This has been interpreted as a slip of the pen for <i>ganza</i>;
but it may be a Lombardism for <i>gazza</i>. In the latter case we should
translate it &quot;magpie,&quot; in the former &quot;sweetheart.&quot; I prefer to read
<i>gazza</i>, as the ironical analogy between a magpie and a poet is
characteristic of Ariosto.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_621_622" id="Footnote_621_622"></a><a href="#FNanchor_621_622"><span class="label">[621]</span></a> The irony of this passage is justly celebrated. After all
his hopes and all the pontiff's promises, the poet gets a kiss, a
trifling favor, and has to trudge down from the Vatican to his inn. The
<i>mezza bolla</i> is supposed to refer to the fine for entrance on the
little benefice of Sant'Agata, half of which Leo remitted.</p></div>

separation from his mistress. Written to ease his heart in solitude, it
is more impassioned and less guarded than the epistle.</p></div>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
